The pancakes could be a bit less crunchy on the outside because when it starts getting cold and you mix it with the maple syrup can be difficult to cut and eat, however the taste is amazing.   The granola with fruits was really good but if they add a bit less of cinnamon, you can taste better the rest of the ingredients.

The seating is well arranged with plenty of space between tables to move and several banks of plush booth seats.

Looking through the main menu, it was quite large and detailed but dishes averaged somewhere around ¬£12-15 per person - not unreasonable considering the quality of what we recieved on a set menu. Our grumble with this restuarant was the poor service we recieved from the waiting staff. Although attentive to our daughters experience, they ignored both of us adults. I asked for drink at the start of the meal and didn't recieve it until I had asked for it twice and was then given the wrong drink (given how long I had waited for it in the first place, I didn't want to risk being forgotten again) - this was then followed by us not being offered dessert by anybody, which at the time we wanted, but once again decided not to bother for risk of being forgotten again. Then, we tried to get the bill, I think we waited about 10 minutes for a waiter to notice we were waiting for the bill and then the card machine.

He took the nachos off our order and didn‚Äôt charge us for the drinks but in my opinion as only 2 bites were taken out the burgers we shouldn‚Äôt have been charged for any of it. There was plenty of staff on hand but many seemed to be just going out for smoke breaks.",-1,0.9946566820144653

So let's start - Service was fine, not particularly attentive or pro-active but fine for a Sunday. Atmosphere... I had to double-check I was in a restaurant - it was fullish but about as dead as the beef I was about to suffer through. The beef was almost comically tough, like a leather placeholder had been served as though they'd forgotten to cook enough for service. I waited 5 minutes for the sides only to realise that they were already on my plate! A pound coin-sized serving of each served as a sample to the flavourless combinations that might actually be full dishes for any lucky punter visiting on a regular service day - for this, I count myself lucky that I only had to taste, rather than eat, the apparent 'side' for my meal. To top it off, it was cold - zero f**ks were given and zero enjoyment was had. I didn't complain on the day but I should've. Maybe the small plates and regular a la carte are more their thing - Sorry guys, but I'll never know. Service 3/5. Food 0.5/5. No atmosphere.p.s.

You can even go five dishes if you're really hungry. The dishes were very cutting-edge, but we really liked most of them. Not your ordinary Indian food, but with the flavors and ingredients of India.

Arrived on time for our 12.30 table booking, place wasn't particularly full, maybe 5 or 6 tables of people. Took 15 minutes to take a drinks order and managed to miss someone. Starters (only 2 people out of the 15) arrived after about 25 mins and looked small but were part of the meal deal so OK I guess. After an hour of waiting for the mains, we were told our food was coming after we asked (not one of the waiters had come to let us know they were having trouble, or were busy etc) and was on the pass, only for that food to be taken to another table. Our food finally came out an hour and 10 minutes after we had arrived. The two fish mains were sent back to the kitchen as inedible as the fish was so over cooked as was a butterfly piripiri chicken. Some of the mains were advertised as ""All individual steaks are garnished with field mushroom, crushed garden peas & roast tomato"", no mushrooms, peas were to be seen and an uncooked half tomato was the only garnish on the plate.Two steaks were sent back to the kitchen to be cooked further as despite being ordered medium well done and medium, both were far too rare. These were then brought back to the table without any of the sides that had been on them plates sent back, and when queried a couple of portions of greasy fries were sent out along with another uncooked tomato half.Several of the group had ordered a 3 course meal and the desserts which arrived again took forever to arrive and were of measly proportions. I certainly wouldn't have paid full price for them but as part of the meal deal I guess it was OK value. Again I didn't have one so can't comment on the taste.It's the first time personally I've been there, and would never return.

As part of a large group, and as a goodbye lunch for a colleague, our lunch was pre-booked many days in advance, however the organisation we were met with certainly left a lot to be desired.First, i'll start with the positives, there being very few from our trip. The aesthetics of the restaurant are very attractive, a far cry from the drudgy old bank that used to reside. We were not greeted by anyone immediately as we entered, however we were seated relatively swiftly, with perhaps 5 or so other tables of diners in occupation.Now we move on to where things fall downhill. Rapidly. (Or not depending on your interpretation of irony). Once seated, it was perhaps a good 15, maybe 20 minutes before our drinks orders were taken, where I was subsequently entirely ignored by the server, having to catch him on his way back with the drinks some time later. Fast forward another 10-15 minutes and the two (yes, two, out of 15) of our party that ordered starters were finally approached with their food. I believe it was fish goujons, and chicken wings, both small portions but as part of the three-course-deal this was not considered a major issue. Now we shall fast forward again, perhaps a further 30 minutes give or take, where we were now having to chase up with the staff where our main courses were, to be advised that they were in final preparation and would be with us shortly, the waiter even gesturing to the dishes being plated up in the serving area visible.Now, as a large group of now very hungry guests, it was particularly demoralising to then see said dishes be served to other guests, with no sign of ours making their way to the front of house. A further ten minutes pass, and we see more dishes begin to materialise, could it be ours? Thankfully yes, and the waiter began passing the food among our guests, great - the food is here, and our mood is lifted. Or is it?Now, let's cut to the chase. Three mains (including my own) were sent back to the kitchen, in all honesty - effectively inedible, a seabass main, a fish grill main, and a butterfly chicken main. I cannot say that I have ever had to vigorously chew a seabass fillet before, and I did not particularly enjoy doing so here. Along with these three plates of sorrow, two further dishes were returned to the kitchen, although this time to be actually cooked:As a specialist steak restaurant, we found it particularly gobsmacking, that two steak orders, one medium-rare and one medium-well, were practically still mooing on the plate. Upon return, whilst still not perfect the dishes were edible, though missing any of the sides they were sent back with until this was queried. The remaining guests reported good to average meals in fairness, though did comment that overcooking was a common theme, as was small portion sizes.The same two guests who ordered starters later (by later - this whilst the discussion was being had over what would make it to the bill, where we did have to check that the desserts actually still existed) received the 3rd course of their set - the pavlova, which again were very small though one would imagine this is why they are in the three-course-deal in the first place. As far as taste I believe there was no concern with these.As we near the end of this wonderous afternoon of wasted time and now for me at least, stomach grumbling hunger, it came time to pay the bill. Upon questioning the waitress as to the significant delays given our pre-booking, the rude delivery of the as ever pathetic excuse along the lines of  'we had a number of other guests to attend to' left a sour taste in my mouth - the only taste I had in my mouth I will reiterate.In all, a pre-booked lunch took the best part of 2-hours to suffer through, with inedible food, inattentive staff, and no apology in sight. The three returned dishes were removed from the bill and the remaining group settled up. So will I ever return here personally? No, I shall not, nor will I be shy about giving my thoughts on our visit whenever pertinent.I am certainly no expert in running a business, however can I perhaps suggest that if there is going to be a wait, you may wish to inform your guests of this, rather than hide from sight or fob them off, and if heaven forbid things do go poorly, you may wish to consider an apology as a way to soften the blow. Who knows, maybe this review wouldn't have taken as long as one of your meals in that case.",-1,0.8363744020462036

We chose second option but drinks followed regardless :). The menu is simple, well described and not overwhelming with great selection of local wines and porto. We ordered:Marinated Olives: We loved their olives. This is always a good start to pair with wine.Octopus Salad: as an avid fans of octopus served in any dish we had to try their salad. It was delicious with noticeable hints of smoked paprika soaked in citrusy vinaigrette.Tuna Tartar: definitely one of the top ones we had eaten so far. Very fresh with radish, chives, avocado and wasabi eggs. This is an appetizer I could eat everyday.Prawns al Ajillo: the biggest ones they are serving. You pay for two pieces, simply grilled but served from heaven. We chose basmati rice side dish which was so buttery and flavorful making itself a perfect combination. Do not forget to squeeze the juice from the prawns heads, this is the best natural seafood sauce ever!!We had a bottle of our favorite Alvarinho to compliment our food.

Well the service was fast, and we were promised the freshest burger we had ever eaten when placing our order. I'm not sure it was quite that, but it was a really nice burger  and the portion sizes are huge! We all had the Killer burger and it literally did kill us, so much so we never made it to the old town that night as we were so full! Now I am big eater so it takes quite a lot to finish me off! If you have plans for the evening then I highly recommend going for something a little lighter than the killer! We ordered it as part of the Killer combo deal and I asked for a side of chips with chilli and cheese, this was fantastic even though I didn't manage to eat it all. The lemonade which came as part of the combo was really delicious! We couldn't have possibly tried one of the shakes, that really would have finished us off, but they looked amazing!

When we arrived, our reserved table was a table for four with an extra chair at the end of one of the tables.  That was ridiculous for five people as there simply wouldn't have been room for the fifth plate so we asked for a different table which, as the restaurant wasn't busy, wasn't an issue luckily.The waitress then wanted to take our order a matter of minutes after we'd been seated and given the menus - we were still reading the menu so asked her to come back.  Of course, when we had all chosen what we wanted, we couldn't find anyone to take the order!!We ordered a couple of starters to share between the table - crescentine and pane all aglio - both were fine, if a little greasy.For the main courses we ordered 2 x maccheroni pesto rosso, 1 tortelloni di asparagi, 1 x linguine alle vongole and 1 lasagne pasticciate - all were fine, nothing special.For dessert we ordered 1 pizza nutella to share between two, 1 tiramisu, 1 affogato and 1 caffe goloso with the chocolate brownie - this was probably the best course.What we were really annoyed about - but didn't know until the bill was presented - was that we had ordered a bottle of house wine and were told house wine only came in a carafe which we were then charged ¬£26.95 for.  When I looked on the website afterwards, it clearly states that the bottle of house wine costs ¬£11.90 - we were ripped off to the tune of ¬£15.05 which is completely disgraceful.Obviously the staff are trained to up-sell on the drinks but it is completely dishonest to tell them to tell the customer that the only option for house wine is a carafe (which we weren't told the cost of and would never have guessed it would have been anywhere near the ¬£26.95 charge) when a bottle of house wine is actually ¬£11.90.A 12.5% service charge was also added - this amounted to ¬£15.48 - the service wasn't good and possibly the reason why is because the servers know they're going to get the tips anyway.So, our bill came to ¬£139.28 - this did not represent good value for what we received and, as previously stated, because we were totally ripped off with the wine, it's left a very bad taste in our mouth.",-1,0.9851790070533752

For some context and better understanding, the restaurant is located in Place Jourdan best known in Brussels for its Maison Antoine located the middle of the square which is one of the 2 oldest friteries priding with the best you can eat Belgian fries. There is an unwritten rule that you can serve the fries on all the terraces while ordering beer or something from the restaurants. This being said, we were 2 persons, I went to buy the fries (there are very long waiting ques usually) and my companion took a seat on the terrace of Ellis to order burgers and some drinks - important to mention that we talk about the terrace located in the middle of the square, across the road and not the terrace located on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant. Upon my return, drinks were already served and in less than 5 minutes a server brings the burgers. Seeing that we had the fries from Maison Antoine, he kindly informs us of the policy of Ellis that they don't allow their customers to buy and consume fries from somewhere else but as the burgers are served he is kind enough to make a joke and agrees to make an exception this time. Less than 5 minutes and the manager arrives informing us she is in charge and despite having the approval of her colleague waiter, we have to pack our fries in order to continue eating. Needless to say we were both enjoying the burgers up to that moment which lasted for another 5 minutes of intense debate during which we acknowledged the strict policy of the restaurant but as we were not informed before ordering, we asked to be left to finish our dinner in peace. Finally after several times asking, the lady visibly irritated by the fact that we did not agree to leave or pack our fries stormed out saying we'll pay a supplement. Of course our appetite was dead and asked for the check immediately. Having to pay inside by the counter (rule of the restaurant) I had to deal with the manager again as she tried to force me pay an extra amount of 3 Euros because not ordering fries from them with the threat that she will call the police if I don't agree. Furthermore, we were both called liars several times just because we did not order fries from the restaurant and were informed that we are no longer welcome there.

It's nicely served on the design side but not really a single touch of cooking, except maybe cutting oignon and cumcumber. We had half a chicken and tacos with grated chicken: I wonder how was my chicken grated as I has pieces instead. The sauce was of course industrial as was the salad dressing which was awful. The taste of the chicken is ...the taste of a mid-range chicken, really nothing exceptional. If you cook an organic chicken at home or a chicken that has the 'Label Rouge' (80 days breeding minimum), you definitely have a better taste.The supposedly potatoes cooked in the oven were not: they were boiled and then put in a pan to fry a bit. I mean, if you cook at home you cannot miss these details. The crunch of a potato in the oven was completely absent. Idem for the chicken seasoning/broth: if you do it at home yourself, you know how it tastes.Fries: they were also uninteresting: ok they have a special design and it's nice for the eye and....that's it: they were not crunchy at all, felt really industrial and had for some of them (enough to be noticed) potato black eyes. When you think the almost most famous frit-kot of Brussels is around the corner, the comparison doesn't resist.So in the end, the place feeds you with a certain price, you probably won't get sick, they serve quite swiftly, so if this is was you're looking for, go. For the rest, it unfortuanely felt like a good old marketing product surfing on a poshy placement on the market. Other places on the square are cheaper or equivalent in price and tastier.",-1,0.9843196272850037

We had a very rare date night for me and my hubby here and boy did he choose well! We were seated in a booth,next to the kitchen, nice and cosy. Away from other tables so we could hear eachother clearly, yet close enough to the atmosphere to hear the music and happy chatter. Our starters were amazing, we ordered the ham and leak croquettes and the king prawns. Unfortunately for me, I had a reaction to the prawns and came out in a rash, but that's my own fault as I assume they cooked them where the lobster is cooked and I have an allergy (completely forgot to say!) However, this wasn't an issue at all as it tasted amazing! Main course was even better. Whenever me and my husband go out we find it really hard to settle on dishes, so instead we ordered 2 dishes and shared so that way we could taste more.He ordered a platter and I ordered a beef wellington (which can I just say was oh. My. Stop talking good.) Between us we had the wellington, lamb steak (our favourite- simply delicious), Piri Piri chicken (also..need to add this... So very moist and tasted beautiful, like a delicate flavour), steak (again, saliva filling mouth thinking of it), BBQ ribs- the meat basically fell off the bone! And then sides of onion rings and sweet potato fries. Compliments, and I mean there were several orgasmic compliments, to the chef's!! Thankyou to them for making me realise that my cooking, in actual fact, sucks.Pudding was a bit of a give or take here. To be honest, we could have just left without it- probably should have too, working my food baby.The coffee was delicious though that came alongside pudding.We will definitely be coming back here.

We were a group of four but my brother's starter didn't turn up until 20 minutes after the rest of us had been served and finished our starters, and this was only because we'd reminded the waiter it was missing - I'm convinced he'd forgotten about it and it wouldn't have arrived at all if we hadn't said something.

Not busy, with the number of other parties in the dining room just about covering off the fingers on one hand. Apart from the ladies in the hen group we thought we'd crashed a well attended meeting of those who'd voted for a certain former Peterborough MP in the recent by-election.I should say that my daughters' steaks were fine as was the bottle of Voignier (at twenty two quid), which for me was the high point of the visit. That's where the good bits end. Not being a fan of steak, after being advised that what I'd ordered first off had run out I settled for something else that looked interesting - the mushroon wellington from the veggie section of the menu. I was slightly bemused when I was asked how I'd like it cooked (well done etc). My wife ordered a spicy chicken dish. When the food finally got to the table I received what looked to be an imitation of a Greggs vegetable pasty and my wife's chicken was simply ""painted"". If you choose to forego the skin (as many do) what you're left with is, well, a piece of plain grilled chicken - no attempt made to score or marinade it although I can guess the reason for that. I suspect my ""wellington"" came out of a box delivered by a 3663 driver, Brake Bros, or whoever Middleton's use and went straight into the oven.After one of the kitchen staff had attempted to bend one in, and simply re-plated something that went back rather than replace it as I was promised (the bite I'd taken out of it was a bit of a clue), the  replacement arrived at about the same time as everyone else had finished. One of my daughters called for the desert menu and popped off to the ladies. When she returned a few minutes later, I asked her what she was going to order and she said ""I'm not going to bother. I don't think we should give this place any more of our money than we have to"". So apart from the little'un deserts were binned and my wife called for the bill.The DM removed the price of my main and knocked another tenner off for the impromptu rendition of Fawlty Towers. Despite this, the bill still clocked in at over a hundred quid and I could see my wife grimace as she handed over her credit card. She said later she resented having to pay every penny - which is no surprise bearing in mind the bill represents a week's earnings for her in her part-time job.Hey ho, lessons learned. One of the waiting staff did apologise profusely for the delays and the kitchen sending something back out that should have gone in the bin. I've never heard a waitress/waiter use the terms ""I'm taking ownership of this problem"" and ""representative of the company"" before on a dining floor, and I suspect both of these phrases can be found in the induction training manual for serving staff somewhere. I'm sure she was sincere, but regrettably such BS management phrases are usually lost on me (as I have to suffer many of them on a daily basis at work) and it just moved my patience gauge slightly further into the red. A simple ""sorry, we screw up sometimes"" would have sufficed.Yet another chain restaurant I think we'll be avoiding in the future. Sorry guys.",-1,0.6600615382194519

Their meals were exactly the same despite one ordering big kids and one ordering small kids. Neither liked their burgers as they tasted burnt so just ate the chips. Maybe this is because they are chargrilled but I imagine most kids would prefer a burger which didn't taste burnt. My beanburger and chips was fine but very basic, no side salad or anything, you would expect a bit more from a restaurant like this. The desserts were a shambles. One child ordered chocolate fudge brownie with no ice cream but it came with ice cream. One child ordered build your own banana split which was supposed to come with sprinkles, choc buttons and chopped strawberries according to the menu. What arrived was half a banana, cut in half with a lump of ice cream. We had to ask for the other things and were told they didn't do choc buttons any more. One adult ordered sticky toffee pudding and custard and received the tiniest toddler sized piece of pudding, with ice cream, not custard.

Whilst the food was cooked just fine, the dishes lacked any flavour. We had ordered the calamari and the breaded mozzarella balls as a starter, as well as 2 coke drinks. The mozzarella balls were fine with the sauce provided (probably the most flavoured item of our lunch) but the calamari was rubbery and tasteless. As our mains, we ordered a simple pesto dish and a meatball dish. It was as if an entire jar of pesto had been added to the spaghetti and yet I still had to add pepper and salt as this dish was bland. The meatballs seemed a bit raw in the middle but when we checked with our server, she said that the kitchen said this was how it was cooked. Again, the dish was bland. We eat at many restaurants and don't mind paying a bit more for good food but when the bill came, and it was over ¬£53, I thought the quality of food was poor and not worth that at all.

Five minutes later we got our burgers (I think I got another burger than I ordered but this could have been a misunderstanding, after more than 70 minutes I wasn't sure about my order), minus the onion rings (they would have take another 15 minutes so we didn't want them any more). But the really bad thing wasn't even the delay, it was how it was dealt with. We waited for over an hour and during this time nobody cared to ask if everything was o.k. They didn't even ask if we would like to order another drink, my beer was finished after about 20 minutes. Nobody cared that everybody got their food except us. After it was obvious that they made a mistake, the only person who said ""sorry"" was our young waiter, no manager came to apologize, nothing.

We arrived for lunch at 2.00pm, a waitress came by to ask for our drink order, after which we were promptly forgotten. We didn't receive the menu, and so we moved to a different table with menus. We waited another 20 minutes for someone to take our order, trying to catch the attention of the lone waitress who was busy behind the bar. We were unsuccessful - we couldn't even place an order. This is the second instance of less than ideal service here, and this time, the experience was downright terrible. Do not recommend this anymore.Updated 9 November 2018: 4 starThe experience this afternoon was a lot less impressive compared to last time - the ratings have been downgraded accordingly. Our lunch order of two sandwiches took an impressively long time. The quality of the old cheese sandwich (which we also had last time) was sub-par. The sandwich was dry, missed the attention to detail and flavour that had left us impressed the last time. Our server made a mistake with our order (we received a flat white instead of a double macchiato - not the same thing), but tried to serve it anyway saying they were pretty much the same thing. They obliged and corrected the mistake when we made it clear that it was not what we had ordered. This is still a good cafe, however, not as exceptional as the first time around.Original review August 2018: 5 starLovely cafe, wonderful cosy interiors, delightful menu, one can tell that a lot of thought has gone into the food, delicious!

We ordered our food and enjoyed it even though it was a long wait between servings and the restaurant lacked staff. As I carried on drinking my Mocktail  I started to feel very nauseous. The reason why I ordered the Mocktail and not the alcoholic cocktail was due to being on a course of antibiotics that would react with any alcohol. Upon receiving the bill we were charged for a cocktail, once I raised my concerns with the older gentleman who served us, he looked at me in petty, put his hand on my shoulder and asked ‚Äò Do you feel ok though‚Äô I was shocked and appalled for two reasons, one for being served something different to what I had ordered and two for the waiters behaviour when I highlighted the issue, I explained that I only wanted a Mocktail as I couldn‚Äôt drink and all he said was ''sorry, I will buy you a drink next time''.

I have never before taken time out to write a review or complaint about an establishment but me and my partner‚Äôs experience definitely warrants one. We pre booked our table over the phone for 7:30pm on Saturday 2nd March 2019, being our anniversary.We arrived on time but were asked to wait at the bar whilst our table was being prepared.After 30 minutes we were seated with no apology. Once seated it seemed to take forever and a day for somebody to tend to us. When somebody finally came we order a bottle of Rioja. Unfortunately, the waiter who took the order must have fell of the face of the earth as this order did not arrive.Only after a further 30 minutes when my partner went to the bar in search for our drinks order, was a different waiter sent over to be reminded of what it was we ordered. Still, with no urgency from the staff we finally got our bottle only to be served along side 2 gin glasses to drink it from. We were told they had ran out of wine glasses only for the table directly next to us to be served a bottle of white wine, with wine glasses less than 5 minutes later. After one hour since arrival we were more than ready to order our food. We ordered mussels to share as a starter, I ordered a fillet medallion with dauphinois, mixed greens and a side of peppercorn sauce for my main.My partner ordered the vegetarian mushroom wellington with dauphinois and mixed greens also, for her main.We waited a further HOUR for our starter to arrive after asking staff multiple times when it might arrive. When it did arrive it was lovely. By this time I decided to time how long it would take for our mains to appear, we waited a further 90 minutes for this to happen. When they finally started to arrive my partners well done and over cooked mushroom wellington came out 5 minutes before my own main, which came with a side of chips rather than dauphinois and without peppercorn sauce. After sending it back to be corrected I finally got what I ordered, along side barely warm peppercorn sauce. All in this time my partner had almost finished her plate due to being so hungry. We ate our mains separately and with water as our wine had by this time long gone and didn‚Äôt want the hassle of ordering anything else! By the time we had finished our mains the kitchen had turned all lights off and the chef had left the building on his phone. We were near enough the last party in the restaurant. Once we had finished our plates very clearly unhappy, a waiter approached us with a half hearted apology and explained how they were in the middle of changing their team, which of course had nothing to do with us. All of this time the staff had no urgency toward us and seemed all over the place. It was almost offensive that on our anniversary night we were experiencing such a nightmare whilst staff were leaning against the bar chatting, we even saw 2 members of staff massaging each other‚Äôs shoulders and at one point a waitress twerked whilst waiting for food to deliver to her table. We had booked our table for the specific time of 7:30pm so as we could enjoy our night beyond our meal and go to a few bars. We left the restaurant at 11:30pm with our night completely ruined and in no mood to continue our night resulting in a taxi straight home. With our career‚Äôs and my partner being from Leeds and myself being from Leicester, we consider our time together very sacred. So to have such a disastrous night on our anniversary was very unsettling and upsetting.Overall, a total of 4 hours spent here that night, a catalog of errors and a disaster from start to finish! I feel as though my seven paragraphs do not mirror and stress the horrors we experienced that evening. We will most certainly avoid dining here ever again and I can‚Äôt stress how much everyone reading this should do the same. Especially if it is a special occasion!

Food came out fast and our waiter was attentive. Food: This is where the restaurant was lacking. It did not tase very authentic. I got spaghetti with meatballs. The meatballs were very dry and burnt on the opt smile the pasta was undercooked and poorly seasoned sauce. I was not a fan of their pasta least to say. The garlic bread was great though! I highly recommend it if you decide to come. Overall this was a convenient dining experience, though I wouldn't recommend their food.",1,0.9898466467857361

I have been to this restaurant many times and used to like it as it offered good quality affordable burgers. It still does as a matter of fact but my last couple of experiences here have been tainted by the poor customer service and the wait for the meal. Already twice, and both times when sitting upstairs, I have had to wait substantially for my meal (more thank 35 minutes, which is a lot for a burger place). In both circumstances I had almost finished my drink by the time the food arrived (and let me add that when ordering tea, twice I received the wrong tea bag, had to wait for a new one and in the meantime the warm water became even milder). To add to the frustration was the fact that other tables received their food before I did although they had ordered later. There was one couple who ordered just before we did who waited almost 50 minutes for their food and then had to remind the staff that they had not yet received the sides to their meal. Having said that, these times I experienced delays have been when the restaurant was particularly busy; however, the rudeness of the staff did not help bear with the frustration: the table next to mine experienced a confrontation with the waitress; I had received no apologies for the wait, and to add to it all, when asked at the till if I had a good meal, I explained my frustrations and received as an answer ""oh it is normal when it is busy"" rather than an apology.

We ordered my 2 year old haddock goujons from little eaters menu. Half way through my daughters meal I noticed she wasnt breathing, her eyes where getting wider and wider and watering and she was getting very red in the face. Once she didnt answer me when asking if she was ok I knew straight away she was choking. My husband then had to stand her up on the chair and frantically hit her back to try and get what ever it was she was choking on out. After a minute or so of my daughter struggling to catch breath she eventually asked for her juice and knew something was in her throat as she was trying to cough it out herself. My husband then took my daughter to the toilet and stick his fingers down her throat which eventually cleared it. My daughter from that point refused all food. I then decided to break some of the Haddock up to feed my 10month old to find 2 fish bones in the fish. When finding these bones i knew this was what my daughter swallowed which got lodged in her throat. I am horrified that bones are being served in the fish which was ordered off the kids menu. Thorough checks should have been in place to make sure this doesn't happen to any child ordering off this menu. If I hadn't have gone to feed my 10month old we would never have found the bones and been able to warn others. This left my daughter upset and it took her untill today to stop talking about it. Also everyone in the restaurant knew my 2 year old was choking and we needed help. However 2 members of staff walked past as if nothing was happening. As soon as I alerted the manager of what just happened all I got was an apology. I then spoke to the manager again to let him know we was leaving as I was so angry with the whole situation and experience from the staff and manager when informing him about the bone. It wasnt untill I was leaving and he asked for the bones to show the chef I then expressed I am keeping a bone for a picture he then decided to take my details for a lady called Emily to be calling me back which I still havnt received this call. I feel the restaurant havnt taken full responsibility or care in regards to this and it could have been a lot worse then what it was.

I ended up with the Guaco Waco Lamb burger which came looking a bit dry but was quite tasty! There were some condiments on the table (ketchup and  tabasco sauces) to help elevate the flavours if necessary. The sweet potato fries were good too and the better option to the plain fries, in my opinion.Ambience - The restaurant is quite nicely decorated; chequered tiles, motifs on the walls and has some influence of an American deli. It‚Äôs not quite cosy and is quite a long and narrow space. There are sitting areas outside but be mindful that people do smoke!Accessibility - The outside areas are accessible but there are steps leading into the restaurant and going towards the back dining area.

For some context and better understanding, the restaurant is located in Place Jourdan best known in Brussels for Maison Antoine located the middle of the square which is one of the 2 oldest friteries priding with the best you can eat Belgian fries. There is an unwritten rule that you can serve the fries on all the terraces while ordering beer or something from the restaurants. This being said, we were 2 persons, I went to buy the fries (there are very long waiting ques usually) and my companion took a seat on the terrace of Ellis to order burgers and some drinks - important to mention that we talk about the terrace located in the middle of the square, across the road and not the terrace located on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant. Upon my return, drinks were already served and in less than 5 minutes a server brings the burgers. Seeing that we had the fries from Maison Antoine, he kindly informs us of the policy of Ellis that they don't allow their customers to buy and consume fries from somewhere else but as the burgers are served he is kind enough to make a joke and agrees to make an exception this time. Less than 5 minutes and the manager arrives informing us she is in charge and despite having the approval of her colleague waiter, we have to pack our fries in order to continue eating. Needless to say we were both enjoying the burgers up to that moment which lasted for another 5 minutes of intense debate during which we acknowledged the strict policy of the restaurant but as we were not informed before ordering, we asked to be left to finish our dinner in peace. Finally after several times asking, the lady visibly irritated by the fact that we did not agree to leave or pack our fries stormed out saying we'll pay a supplement. Of course our appetite was dead and asked for the check immediately. Having to pay inside by the counter (rule of the restaurant) I had to deal with the manager again as she tried to force me pay an extra amount of 3 Euros because not ordering fries from them with the threat that she will call the police if I don't agree. Furthermore, we were both called liars several times just because we did not order fries from the restaurant and were informed that we are no longer welcome there. Thanks a lot Ellis Gourmet Burger for the nice treatment of your customers, it was indeed one different and never to forget experience.",-1,0.9994530081748962

The menu also has a small selection for kids.With each burger the menu offers a helpful  selection of recommended beers. Burger prices are very steep if compared to prices at  a golden arches fast food chain, but you get much more than the tasteless bun and third grade meat. Here buns are  premium bread and sizeable, and the burgers, both meat and non meat versions are distinguishably of a premium quality. The burger itself is accompanied by a jar of mayolike based apple and other vegetable mix- interesting concept. This might not be to everyone's liking though- as the traditional way of serving burgers in Belgian would be with a larger salad and fries- at a comparable price. If you want fries, they cost  extra, but worth it-though one portion per two people would for most people be enough (large hand cut , baked in grease, yet not over-greasy and perfectly crunchy and soft in all the right places).As to drinks, as mentioned they have a very satisfying selection of beers that are matched with the burgers, as well as tasty home made jar served lemonades.Places fill up quickly on sunny evenings so come early or call ahead. Service is generally friendly and accommodating, however...On the down side, every single table around us was served a wrong order.  Clearly the order system, though seemingly  hi-tech with mobile devices and special buzzing watches, was no match for the sunny summer evening crowd. Double check your bill when paying as we did not receive all the orders we made, yet were charged for them. The non-supplied orders were deducted once pointed out, as was the case with the people around us.When leaving I was stopped non-discretely at the exit and asked whether I had not forgotten to pay,  by the same waiter I had paid to at the cash register five minutes earlier. Again, after a verification in the system, a technical mistake apparently- though a waiter should at least remember a paying client's face for more than five minutes... Order mixups, being billed for non delivered food, being stopped  from leaving in public and asked to pay when one has just paid to the same waiter- these are all mistakes which should not occur in an establishment which clearly has put in effort to bring  an impressive menu with quality food in an otherwise pleasant setting to those willing to pay premium prices for premium food.Despite the downsides, definitely a place I will be revisiting with my colleagues and friends, and hopefully this time without the technical and human glitches in the system...",-1,0.8686237335205078

She said we were the second on the list. I asked, ‚Äúoh okay, there are 3 empty tables, please could we be seated?‚Äù She said she will, please wait. Fast forward 20 minutes later, and the tables were still empty. I am not sure why we couldn‚Äôt have been seated earlier, even just to have our drinks - we had ordered our second round so it‚Äôs not as if we weren‚Äôt paying. Were we kept standing outside just to create ‚Äúvibe‚Äù? Anyway after more than 90 minutes of standing outside in full view of the waitress, we were finally seated. Ordered some form of croquettes, tuna ceviche and octopus salad and garlic prawns. Garlic prawns never came. First three items painfully average - tuna soggy in the way that frozen and thawed fish is - not what I‚Äôd consider appropriate for ceviche. Octopus salty and devoid of flavour (apart from salty.) All in all food that is definitely not worth a 90 minute wait. There are tonnes of better places to eat in Lisbon. The people queuing outside the restaurant are kept there for a reason. Do not trust the vibe.",-1,0.9939064383506775

While living in the Netherlands I had my first date with my bf there and since then it became our tradition to go back every special time. Now, living in Gent, the idea was keeping that alive, but things have gone sour. First of all, something that its quite sad, the fries, at least somewhere at the end of 2015 beginning of 2016 (while still in the NL) fries were proper potato wedges which later became the frozen normal fries you get in the frituur place... I know you still have the sweet potato wedges but apparently getting decent salty ones is no longer an option. It really gave you edge against other peasant places with the common fries. Secondly, why on earth did you remove your strawberry lemonade from the menu, you were the only place where I could find a decent lemonade that was not the disgusting syrope+water drink that you normally get on the kids' menu. I have tried the new hibiscus and other infusions but they are not comparable to the deceased strawberry lemonade. Thirdly, I have ordered at least 10 times on uber eats putting extra comments on adding an extra Ellis sauce which is worth of all my respects since I believe it is great (I LOVE THAT SAUCE) and adds a lot of value to either the burger or the already sad fries... but no... I cannot get the sauce in my order. Apparently, it is impossible for either the uber eats guy or the place to put it inside my bag. Does it have an extra cost?? let me know and I gladly pay it, however, when being in the establishment I have ordered extra sauce several times with no problem nor extra charge... so, what's up there? I just came back from one-month surgery recovery, and I ordered my usual, guess what, no sauce...If there was one thing I could have rescued from the new era would be the cheesecake with the bits of raspberry and chocolate, but guess what, last time I ordered it wasn't on my bag...Why guys!!! Please bring Ellis back to its shiny days... Sincerelya soon former fan of Ellis burger",-1,0.9988508224487305

Between the two of us, we got to share a whole lobster (half chilled, half hot saut√©ed), two types of fish (one filet and one whole), tons of mussels, clams (including my favorite razor clams too!), shrimps, oysters, crabs, calamari, etc. Literally anything seafood you could think of were presented. And the menu is so flexible that you can mix and match to get different combinations to satisfy your appetite. Everything was super fresh and top notch quality. We especially enjoyed shell fishes such as mussels and clams. For the mussels back home in the US, I could not think of any other cooking method than boiling them in white wine to remove the fishy taste.

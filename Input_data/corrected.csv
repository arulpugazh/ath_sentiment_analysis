3,zomato,eng,1,food,"I am surprised the reviews on Zomato are low, it's easily a 4+ restaurant. They have a very interesting type Indian food in tapas style with a modern twist. The portion sizes are small as with tapas. The presentation is nice and the food tasted good. I have been a few times to the place and always left happy.",1

56,zomato,eng,1,food,"When you think about eating healthy and good in a nice Place, Am√©lia could be a good suggestion. In general the brunch was good, the atmosphere was pleasant and the waiters were kind.   Regarding the food the only things we can suggest is adding a bit of lemon to the avocado toast to give it a zesty touch that combines perfectly with the salty fluffiness of the bread and the creamy avocado.   We loved the crunchiness of the bread on the outside and when you bite it you can taste and feel how fresh it it. The pancakes could be a bit less crunchy on the outside because when it starts getting cold and you mix it with the maple syrup can be difficult to cut and eat, however the taste is amazing.   The granola with fruits was really good but if they add a bit less of cinnamon, you can taste better the rest of the ingredients.   In general terms we totally recommend it for small groups and couple but as a lot of families go there with kids, it could a bit uncomfortable if you wanna have a chill Sunday brunch.   Thank you guys for the great service you offer us today! üòÅ",1

Altough very busy, the staff quickly found us a table even though we had not booked. We chose the 3 course set menu and each course was superb. in fact the pasta I had was the best I have ever tasted. This is a very busy family run restaurant so I think booking would be a good option. Without doubt, a jewel in the crown, fabulous food, fabulous staff, brilliant.",1
70,tripadvisor,eng,1,food;service,"We visited here after a night at Phantom of the Opera so it was quite late on. We sat at our table ordered our food and drink and moments later our drinks arrived, I'm sorry to say the gin and tonic didn't taste too good and I can only guess it was watered down or something else suspicious, now I know I should have complained but as I said it was late and I couldn't be bothered. Shortly after our food arrived and it was really nice, it tasted fresh and was really well flavoured but because of the drinks we decided to not have desert or another drink and just paid the bill and just left. Now I don't want to be harsh because I realise the owner may not know he has a bad bottle of gin and me not complaining at the time doesn't help, but the food was tasty and the waitress was really pleasant.",-1

Service was slow, the servers seemed in no rush to do anything - although not unpleasant I would note! Food wise, we ordered the potato dips to share as a starter - highly recommended!! They were like a chip and a roast potato got triple cooked and had a baby together, covered in cheese and peppers, and served with delicious dips. Burger wise, I had a Bacon Eli (think that was the name) and my boyfriend had a Cheesy Nelson. Both were outstanding, really high quality burgers - not greasy or McDonald‚Äôs like at all. We shared a sideOf chips also (good portion siZe to share if you had a big starter also and aren‚Äôt starving). The beer recommendations with every burger are a nice touch. My boyfriend went with the recommended choice for his and loved it. Definitely worth a visit when in the area - just maybe not if you are in a rush.",1

122,tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food;environment;service,"I live in Middleton and visit middletons regularly. I always go with high expectations and am let down by the steak being over cooked and poor service. I know that recently they have been working hard to improve both- and my god has it worked. The past few months it has got better and better, and it was perfect on my last visit. Service was fast and friendly, a really nice atmosphere and a very good selection of food. If you like your steak, the quality of the meat is absolutely exceptional- best I‚Äôve ever eaten. Seasoned perfectly and you can taste the quality of the meat. All the steaks we ordered were cooked to perfection, and the sides and sauces were brilliant too. I recommend the ribs or haddock Goujons to start, and a prime grill or an 8oz fillet for main. Also probably best to book in advance. It‚Äôs a must if you like your steak, grills or fish. 10/10",1

We left it late, so were offered a seat in the rear terrace, which was FAB - properly heated and very comfy. Service was swift and efficient as before, the waiter switching to English at our glazed response to Flemish. Tried their new ""meatlover"" burger. WOW. Properly cooked, nice and juicy, just a little pink in the middle. The salmon burger was also declared excellent. A surprise hit was the homemade strawberry lemonade - with real bits of strawberry in it. And of course the best fries in the universe. Not just for carnivores though - they do a good range of veggie and even vegan burgers. And other stuff - but I stopped looking after I spotted the Meat Lover.",1

They change the filling and you can choose salad or mashed potatoes. Staff was very attentive explaining how it works. You have water and apples for free in the tables.

We didn't have a start and went all in for the main course. Steak of course. I had a wonderful Fillet Steak. Taste wise fantastic. Seasoning on the outside great. The inside I would have wished a bit more rare but it was Ok. As a side I chose Coleslaw. I know it sounds awkward but that was probably the best Coleslaw I have ever had. It was almost the star of the show. Loved it. They have a good wine selection. We went for red wine Pinot Noir. Perfect with the steak. Staff was very attentive and friendly.

We both enjoyed our dinner very much both times...I had a delicious veggie burger & there was plenty of choice to satisfy my carnivore boyfriend. Delicious fries and coleslaw too in more than adequate portions...I couldn't finish all of my fries. Service was quick and staff really friendly.,1

Again the food was delicious, service was polite, friendly and speedy, and the restaurant is a very pleasant place to be. The fixed menu is incredible value for money at 3 courses for ¬£10, even though the starters and desserts are slightly smaller than if you ordered off the main menu. Our waitress, Summer, couldn‚Äôt have been friendlier and have some good recommendations from the menu.Would highly recommend for any occasion.",1

212,tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service,Arrived on semi busy Friday night. Shown to our table promptly. My wife had a nice view but I was just staring at a bleak entrance way. Pot luck I guess Pre meal drinks and food order was quick and efficient My spicy chicken wings were nice but not spicy in my book Mains arrived and before I had even tried a piece of steak I was asked twice how my meal was . Wish they had asked a few mins later as we realised we had been given each other‚Äôs by mistake. However the steak ( ribeye and sirloin) were delicious and my wife was impressed with the little side salad . The pepper sauce in my opinion was too bland and gloopy to do the steak justice Ordered a cheese board ( nice selection ) between us to finish the lovely bottle of red we  ordered . When it came to the clearance of the plates we were asked about our meal by our main waitress Summer who has been great all night. We have the above honest feedback which she thanked us for We said we would still come back as overall we had a wonderful night . Bill came and our dessert cost was taken off as a gesture of good will which I thought was I nice and unexpected touch . Will return .,-1

Being American Im a huge steak fanatic and always eager to try different places.The decor was great, staff was friendly. We went early which was nice but the place filled quickly while we ate.Awesome children‚Äôs menu that includes a steak option for kids. Which came out cut already so we absolutely loved that and so did my kids. Its also a fixed price and cheap even including a small dessert. Both our little ones devoured their meals with delight.My spouse ordered a steak/rib combo with scalloped potatoes and she enjoyed it and found the ribs to be very tasty, while not US bbq great, for Europe definitely not bad.Her steak was good and the potatoes were delivered as I snuck a bite or two.My meal was good i had the 12oz sirloin with a baked potato. The baked potato was small bit cooked well. The steak was tasty and good to a perfect medium, but seasoning was lacking. I don‚Äôt even think they salt and pepper them before searing which is disappointing. The garlic butter though was key and rescued the steak as i layered it on and enjoyed the flavour it added.I had a baileys cheesecake slice for dessert and enjoyed it very much. My wife had the chocolate  lava cake and loved it as well.Overall a good experience with fair pricing but would highly suggest to season the steaks or at least offer it as an extra. Its amazing how much a little chilli powder/ garlic/ pepper / salt options when added during the cooking process can raise the level of a steak.",1

The atmosphere was good, cocktails and food was lovely. Our waiter too was friendly.The main toilets were a bit hard to find, and there were quite a lot of stairs to reach them.

For mains, I had a fabulous fillet steak which was perfectly cooked (with a lovely dressed salad) as was my husband's rib eye (with new potatoes and crushed peas). Sides come as standard with any dish too. I took a photo before the sauces arrived - Diane for me and mushroom for my husband all freshly made and the flavours are terrific! Lots of choice for desserts too, but we hardly ever have room for them.  Good quality wines - we had the house Portuguese ros√® which is very nice.

Had a look at the menu which seemed very reasonable but decided to check out the Bella Italia across the road where prices were similar. I was pleased we decided on the Spaghetti House. The food was so beautifully cooked and seasoned For starters I had Burrata & Caponata which I highly recommend. My wife's starter was Calamari which she enjoyed very much. My main was Sea Bass, it was out of this world. My wife had Asparagus Risotto which I was privileged to taste, again wonderful and creamy. Salvatore looked after us. He kept us entertained, as Italian waiters seem to do, and chatted to us as though time didn't matter. We left the restaurant happy, then I asked my wife what the bill was, How did that happen I thought.12.5% service charge, ¬£4 for a small bottle of water.

839,tripadvisor,eng,1,food;service,"I had the vegan legendary burger, which was so yummy! The service was really good, I did have to wait a while for my burger, but I think that is a sign that they are making it fresh and putting effort into it!! The restaurant is also really nice, they have some really nice decorations in it. Even my brother who isn't vegan really enjoyed the food.",1
841,tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food;service,"Having never ventured to Peterborough before, I was pleasantly surprised to we gracefully welcomed to Middleton Steakhouse by Ivan of whom was both friendly and engaging. However the star of the show was Kayleigh, of whom when I made I‚Äôd abundantly clear it was my birthday (30‚Äôth) was right on the ball and made sure she humoured our table at every opportunity. She not only made us feel welcome she also enhanced the experience with her bubbly attitude and attentive nature. For a rather demanding table she didn‚Äôt fail to deliver and even surprised us with a chocolate sauce ‚Äúhappy birthday plate‚Äù. I wouldn‚Äôt normally contribute to Tripadvisor as I eat out most days, but this example of outstanding customer service deserves recognising for going above and beyond! Also the food was pretty decent too! 10/10",1

The food came in good time and was very tasty.  The portion size was perfect and the choice of sides were good too.  It is a shame they charge you for steak sauce and considering they charge you, they should fill the pots up more.Other than that, a very enjoyable evening and would definitely go back.",1

My beloved mustard greens were gone, but luckily they were replaced with salad greens, which were so succulent.My waitress was, once again, the lovely Celeste who looked after me wonderfully. I definitely couldn't have managed any dessert after eating all I did; Keralan Chicken, Salad Greens, and Leek and Potato Paratha. And the Croquettes as well. Everything was wonderful.",1

The first time, the waiter wasn't that friendly, but I am guessing he just had a bad day since he was very cheery the second time I visited. The burgers are really good, only a bit expensive if you are a student.",1
856,tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service,"Had the spicy prawns followed by Middleton burger. Burger was tasty but out of proportion with huge bun which made it look small. I would prefer a double burger with bacon and perhaps a fried egg, but it wasn't on the menu, perhaps match the bun size next time. I think you need to have a couple of sides with the meal. I had a cocktail as it seemed better value than the beer. Service was good and very friendly. I saw other diners meals, it was busy and I saw enough of their meals to make me want to come back sometime",-1

875,tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service;food,"This was a return visit to Middleton‚Äôs and once more we were impressed by the service, offered today by Jess and Amanda.  The food was excellent and Chloe cooked the steaks exactly as we had requested.  Many chefs cook meat the way they see fit.  We had a relaxed, unhurried meal with family.One thing to be aware of is that the flooring in the toilets is a little slippery.",1
876,tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service,"We had a lovely meal at lunchtime. This was myself and parents. They were very accommodating and particularly I would like to mention Mark, the waiter who served us. He was smiley, friendly and very attentive with all aspects of the meal.",1

879,tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food;service,This restaurant has nice cuts of beef and knows how to cook them. That sounds simple but plenty of places manage to get it wrong. Setting is nice and staff are friendly - but mostly it‚Äôs five stars for the meat.,1
880,tripadvisor,eng,1,food;reputation,This was genuinely one of the best meals of our holiday. It was our last night and we just wanted something quick that we could eat outside in the square. The portion was huge and it was really tasty. Would definitely eat here again.,1

890,tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;reputation;service;food,Not being a fan of Indian food I was a little apprehensive to visit Kricket but could not have had a better meal. The waiter took time to check with the chef which dishes were and were not spicy. The food is served tapas style - both the date and pistachio bread and sweet potato truly delicious. Highly recommended ! ,1

895,tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food;service,"Very good service for our table of 9.  A bit disappointed with the fact that even though we pre-booked our food, there were a few of the sides that were unavailable.  That aside the meals were excellent and very well cooked quality meat.

897,tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;value;service,"First visit to this restaurant & curious to see what had been done to ""Jamie's"".  Struggled to open front door, which seems very heavy. Offered table immediately & not herded together with other diners, one of my personal hates! Drinks order taken & arrived quickly. Food order taken but took a bit longer to arrive. Not in any rush so not a problem. I chose from the ¬£9.95 section as I am a non-meat eater & that suited me fine. My starter, the haddock goujons, seemed small (only 2 pieces) but my companions had the brie wedges which were much more generous. My goats cheese tart didn't amount to much, puff pastry square with onions & tomato & a VERY small piece of goats cheese, but was served with asparagus which I love. Pleasant but not outstanding. The others ordered steak & blue cheese burger & both were very pleased with their meal. My dessert, a fruit pavlova, was really small, with defrosted berries & a thumb nail sized blob of cream. The other dessert, a creme brulee, was cold & the caramel topping had been made separately & stuck on top. It was too hard to eat. Our server, Stephan, was excellent & happily answered our questions. I think we will visit again, but I will choose from the main menu to see if the quality, & portion size,is better than the 3 course bargain offer!",-1

I had the 3 course set menu with the BBQ Ribs for a starter and they was very tasty. For my main I had the Minute Steak this had been cooked to perfection to my liking.

I have always found the service to be warm and attentive plus you never feel rushed so you can really take your time to enjoy the atmosphere. The food is consistently excellent, with a special mention to the ¬£9.95 Set Menu which offers three perfectly sized portions at an astonishing price from Monday - Saturday!

There is ready made food and drinks to buy, plus a food counter for hot food. i had the falafel wrap which was very decent but slightly on the bland side. But I'm loving these healthy fast food places that are springing up. The last thing you need on a long journey is highly processed food and endless lattes making you feel terrible.",1

My daughter lives very close and she invited us to dinner at this restaurant. She just kept saying Dad, you will LOVE the views and the food. They do not take reservations so we went about 5:30 and it was quiet and we sat outside (highly recommend) and were greeted by this outgoing, happy and positive waitress. Beautiful day, clear sky and about 78 degrees. The first thing you realize is that as you come up to the building it is up high. Sitting here, overlooking a quarry with huge fountain and beside it a golf course plus off in the distance the entire view of Boston skyline... WOW. That's all you can say.... seriously,... just wow. I would imagine a sunset to be breathtaking and view of Boston at night awesome. The appetizer was shrimp cocktail (see pic) with 12 medium size shrimp. Shrimp were fresh, firm but for my taste cocktail sauce a tad bland but still they were good.I asked if they could do fish n chips since it was not on the menu and they obliged! Perfectly fried haddock, delicious slaw ( i am a slaw critic) and fries just right. My wife got fish taco appetizer which was great for dinner. Too full for dessert but the quality of everything else was superb so I will have to return for the treats another time. Just too full. So, I feel I have to say this is a MUST VISIT. View to die for and food really really good. Service was perfect. Price a smidge high but competitive.They do valet parking but we parked up in the parking lot since it was nice out. Go early or you may have to wait. Enjoy and I hope this helps.",1

I felt the samphire pakoras needed a little more seasoning and less of the sweet sticky sauce but all minor points for a restaurant that I look forward to visiting again.",1

Kricket is the most unusual Indian restaurant I've been to. First, the restaurant is very popular. They open at 5 p.m. for dinner and there was a pretty good line before opening the Saturday night my husband and I went. However, we had no trouble grabbing a couple of seats at the counter (which is more an eating counter than a bar). I highly recommend sitting at the counter, which was comfortable and interesting. You can see how the food is made and the very friendly staff is delighted to chat with you about the process, the ingredients and the sort of Kricket food philosophy. It became a bit of a show and added to our enjoyment. The entree portions are tapas-sized, so four dishes to share between two people is a good idea. You can even go five dishes if you're really hungry. The dishes were very cutting-edge, but we really liked most of them. Not your ordinary Indian food, but with the flavors and ingredients of India. One dish wasn't to my taste, but that was just my taste preference. The restaurant atmosphere is also very hip. In all, a fun and delicious evening.",1

Very fresh with radish, chives, avocado and wasabi eggs. This is an appetizer I could eat everyday.Prawns al Ajillo: the biggest ones they are serving. You pay for two pieces, simply grilled but served from heaven. We chose basmati rice side dish which was so buttery and flavorful making itself a perfect combination.

As for food I have ordered the beyond burger (vegan) and I can say that even my boyfriend who adores meat didn‚Äôt believe that it was a vegan burger, it was really delicious.

Well the service was fast, and we were promised the freshest burger we had ever eaten when placing our order. I'm not sure it was quite that, but it was a really nice burger  and the portion sizes are huge! We all had the Killer burger and it literally did kill us, so much so we never made it to the old town that night as we were so full! Now I am big eater so it takes quite a lot to finish me off! If you have plans for the evening then I highly recommend going for something a little lighter than the killer! We ordered it as part of the Killer combo deal and I asked for a side of chips with chilli and cheese, this was fantastic even though I didn't manage to eat it all. The lemonade which came as part of the combo was really delicious! We couldn't have possibly tried one of the shakes, that really would have finished us off, but they looked amazing! I think this place is worth checking out if your passing or staying nearby, there was also a What's Pizza a few doors down which we never had chance to check out during this stay. Next time!",1

Also, we didn't get any nibbs(paprika corns), which were clearly put on the tables inside of the restaurant, but we needed to ask for one when we saw it.Nevertheless the food was delicious, the desserts were amazing (go for that brownie) and our waiter came back several time to ask if we need something and everything was fine.

He said it was the best steak he's had in ages...and it looked beautifully cooked (medium rare). I had seafood mixed grill which was also really well cooked and delicious. The desserts were a-maz-ing! Baileys cheesecake and sticky toffee pud were just fabulous. Drinks are reasonaly priced. Staff are all friendly and attentive (but not over the top). It was crazy busy on a Saturday night, but the atmosphere was really chilled. My only gripe...being a bit of an eco-warrior...is...that they are still using plastic straws in their cocktails. Not cool! Otherwise, a great find. Definitely going back there...maybe with the teens kids on a Sunday.",1

We had a very rare date night for me and my hubby here and boy did he choose well! We were seated in a booth,next to the kitchen, nice and cosy. Away from other tables so we could hear eachother clearly, yet close enough to the atmosphere to hear the music and happy chatter. Our starters were amazing, we ordered the ham and leak croquettes and the king prawns. Unfortunately for me, I had a reaction to the prawns and came out in a rash, but that's my own fault as I assume they cooked them where the lobster is cooked and I have an allergy (completely forgot to say!) However, this wasn't an issue at all as it tasted amazing! Main course was even better. Whenever me and my husband go out we find it really hard to settle on dishes, so instead we ordered 2 dishes and shared so that way we could taste more.He ordered a platter and I ordered a beef wellington (which can I just say was oh. My. Stop talking good.) Between us we had the wellington, lamb steak (our favourite- simply delicious), Piri Piri chicken (also..need to add this... So very moist and tasted beautiful, like a delicate flavour), steak (again, saliva filling mouth thinking of it), BBQ ribs- the meat basically fell off the bone! And then sides of onion rings and sweet potato fries. Compliments, and I mean there were several orgasmic compliments, to the chef's!! Thankyou to them for making me realise that my cooking, in actual fact, sucks.Pudding was a bit of a give or take here. To be honest, we could have just left without it- probably should have too, working my food baby.The coffee was delicious though that came alongside pudding.We will definitely be coming back here. And probably be bringing my lovely in laws, one of which has caeliac disease, so will be in heaven when she sees what is to offer!

It is self service, meaning you need to wait in line for your food. In our case we had to stand and wait for 45 minutes. Also they work with a card system to pay on the way out. At least that is all they said when introducing the system. Turns out there is some kind of limit per card(still don't know what the limit is, but must be below 50 euro as I spent 52 euro for 4 people). They introduced this limit when it was finally time to ok order after 45 minutes wait and initially they wanted me to go back and get another card and wait again. Which I refused of course as they introduced new rules during the game. Finally the cook also realized how unreasonable this was and solved the problem after 5 minutes additional delay.Conclusion the food is great, just the very inefficient not customer oriented service model ruined it all. Not recommended when there are people in the waiting line.",-1

The quality of the produce, and the depth of flavour of the satays - we ordered pork belly, chicken and succulent steak satays, is unlike any other Indonesian restaurant we've eaten at - both here in Amsterdam and across Asia. Not only was the service impeccable and warm, the overall ambience, on the fifth floor on top of a department store is unique and provides a cavernous, but still cosy space in which to dine. The menu is broad, and if you enjoy rich Asian flavours with authentic ingredients you'll be happily sated here. We booked late - at 5,30 pm for a 6.00 pm seating and were happily accommodated on a Wednesday evening. The decor is something wonderful and eclectic, the views of Amsterdam an added bonus. Loved the open kitchen in the middle of the restaurant and it was clear to us that everyone who worked here had a passion for being there. Thank you Ron GastroBar Indonesia - it was a treat! We've made it our quest to find as many good Indonesian restaurants to try in our new home in Amsterdam (we relocated from Sydney, Australia last month) and are convinced we will not find better than this restaurant for the type of food we love.",1

Just surprising for a steak restaurant when it's what they specialise in to over do it. Wasn't worth complaining about as still enjoyable. Had a few puddings which were mostly great but the brownie was quite bland, we mentioned it to the waitress who offered to replace but we didnt want anything else so took it off the bill which was nice.

They have brought first round of dishes but some of the sides were missing. Later on with the second round of dishes they brought the missing sides but we were already full. Also They brought the two dishes at the same time which made one dish to go cold, which really effected the taste. Waitress did not ask if we needed anything and she did not bring the tap water we have asked. At the end they brought ice-cream as a complimentary but they forgot 1 person.  Nevertheless, we have enjoyed Spare Ribs, Mussels, Brill, Langoustine, Steak Tartare. All the dishes were tasty and the ingredient quality is really high.

Wish other places would do the same. As my other half likes his meat extremely well done Hollie advised us that it would be a while for our food to come out and would we like some nibbles. I guess the warning is so that after 15 mins people aren't complaining about the fact they don't have their meal. I am of the opinion that if it's good food I don't mind waiting.The food was cooked to perfection my lamb rump was cooked rare and tasted amazing.

It would've sweetened the deal even more if the sauce was included, but I can forgive that.For an idea of a meal price, we both had starters, steak and shared a ¬£25 bottle of wine and the entire bill came to ¬£73. Not bad at all.The steak was lovely as was my starter (garlic mushrooms), they had a very comprehensive selection of wines and the service was rock solid. Barely had to wait any time at all for the food to arrive (admittedly this was a very quiet Monday).Decor is relatively no-frills if that's your thing; tidy but fairly unremarkable. But where it mattered most, Middletons delivers affordable steak dining, which there's a curious lack of in Chelmsford town center.",1

Especially the fried fish, the king crab legs, and the clams.  The restaurant was completely full - so it is advisable to have a reservation unless you want to wait an hour for a table.  Service was spotty.  But that did not detract from a very enjoyable meal.",1

What the hell is going on in their minds? They just give you the bill including the exorbitant tip, with no option to remove it, We was there celebrating a special occasion, so I did not want to embarrass my partner, but rang head office the following morning to tell them of my disgust at their inclusive tipping, and guess what? They had the audacity to put me through to the big Russian guy, who‚Äôd served us, fortunately I‚Äôve got plenty of grit, and told him to remove the ¬£9.50 from my already paid bill, after a lengthy discussion he said he would have this amount put back on my card, and it was completed satisfactorily.

The kitchen is in the middle under the arched roof, with tables around it all looking very nice.The food on the other hand was really good. We took the ‚Äòrijst tafel‚Äô, all the dishes served in small portions. Also a choice for veggies. We eat quite a lot of Indonesian food but this is at the high end. Service is good. Sunday live music was a bit too loud for our taste, perhaps check beforehand if that is not your thing. Otherwise Hudson‚Äôs Bay is leaving so hopefully Ron‚Äôs can stay. ",1

We had a seafood day soup with mussels and fish, fried fish, fried fish and a selection of snacks with herring and other things. Everything was exceptionally fresh and tasty.

This large airy restaurant has an outdoor covered terrace. Kricket is usually Anglo-Indian but last night they had a special Anglo Thai Chef Series for September. We started off with a Thainapple Express gin cocktail so good we had a couple more. There was a set dinner starting with BhelnPuri with a caramel fish sauce very moorish and delightfully crunchy. Followed by a Lemongrass Tandoor chicken with mint yoghurt and tamarind, a wild mushroom and Buckthorn Nam followed along with a red curry fish cake with a cucumber sauce. Next course was wild boar curry with pickled gRlic and crispy shallots with pickled red onion sweet yoghurt and turmeric rice. Pudding was a coconut rice pudding with blackberries and butterfly sorrel leaves. We drank a Godello from Galicia and finished with some fresh mint tea. The flavours in this exeptional meal were remarkable, so interesting and intense. I am a great fan of Kricket and enjoy going to their other two restaurants in Denman Street off Shaftesbury Avenue and Brixton. All are well worth a visit White branch is truly delightful.",1

The Lemon Tart was not the best very over baked so wouldn't choose that again.There was a nice atmosphere in the restaurant for a Monday evening  .It would be nice if the lighting was a little softer and maybe some candles on the table just to create a little more of a snug and intimate feeling especially as it is just a big building.Overall a good experience and for a special night we would go again.",0

We had a lovely bottle of wine and had a lovely chat with the waitress who brought us a small glass of Limoncello on the house. Perfect, what can I say.

The portion sizes were generous and having grown up in seaside towns, the quality was readily apparent. Of all the dishes, I recommend the razor clams the most.

Very good value by Amsterdam standards. Lobster bisque had plenty of real lobster meat in a creamless, but still rich, broth. Octopus appetizer is excellent and enough to share. Fried mixed platter was very good, although ""Amsterdam Shrimp"" were an odd choice. Only disappointment was the Mussels  -did not live up to menu description - eventually rectified with addition of drawn butter. All in all a good choice for business or date night dinner. ",1

We chose peppercorn sauce and blue cheese sauce to accompany our steaks - delish! The dishes always have a choice of sides too which is unusual in most steak houses.¬† There's more than steak here though, there's chicken, fish, mussels and the most amazing handmade burgers too.¬† There's also a fabulous set lunch which is incredible value.¬† The choice of wines here is good and we always have the house Portuguese ros√© which is good and great value.¬† There's a good range of cocktails too.¬† Staff here are lovely - all knowledgeable and very friendly.¬† If you want fabulous food, all cooked to order, this is your place!

Our Consierge recommended The Seafood Bar, which is about a 10 minute walk from our hotel.We hit the restaurant at exactly the right time -- before the crowds --we were seated immediately and had the most incredible meal.  I ordered the Asian stye mussels and my husband ordered the Fruits de Mer -- my dish was definitely the hit.  The sauce was a lemongrass, ginger and coconut -- and was superb!!  The icing on the cake for us was our waitress/hostess, Valeria Spataro, a 2nd year university student in Management at the University of Amsterdam -she recommended the perfect wine for the mussels,- and made multiple recommendations as to the best methods for eating both the mussels and the more varied dishes on my husband's menu.  She also mentioned that she makes a wonderful tea, which we didn't try.   Valeria really enhanced our dinner -- and when we come back to Amsterdam, we hope to see her again.Great restaurant -- huge portions.  If you're in the mood for the great seafood, this is the place to go!",1
2351,tripadvisor,eng,1,experience,This place is very busy -especially between 7pm to 9pm. So reservations highly recommended.If you arrive without a reservation you can wait in the front/bar area and outside where drinks and appetisers are served. The first time I was there (solo) I ordeered an appetiser and glass of wine and tI found the portion quite large so just ordered another appetiser and cancelled the dinner reservation.Second time - did not order anything and got a high table within 20-30 mins. Had the mussels and fries and salad. All delicious! Service is very good and friendly...After 9pm - no line up and much calmer. Great place for Seafood!,1
2352,tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food;service,"I recently moved to Leicester and have now visited Middletons 4 times! The food is really excellent, beautifully cooked and served. The wine list is also very good. The Malbec is a definite must to try if you like red wine. The staff are all very pleasant and helpful. On one of my visits with friends the restaurant was quite busy and the wait was a tiny bit longer than normal but the staff were so attentive and advised in advance there may be a slight wait that it didn't matter. It is when there is a wait and the staff ignore you that it is annoying, none of that here, from the front of house to the servers the service is good. The chefs prepare and cook really good food as well. The steaks are superb. I have also been for a Sunday lunch which was really delicious. I have a friend coming soon and we will definitely visit again.",1

He said he would work fast to get us our food and drinks and he did not disappoint.  We were served our drinks within a couple of mins (which I always appreciate in a restaurant and my bugbear is being sat down and then left for ages) and our food came about ten mins later.  The food was tasty and plentiful. i thoroughly recommend this restaurant for a fast tasty efficient pre theatre dinner.,1

I do find even the smaller portions a little large, but that is just me and not a complaint. ",1
2366,tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food,"The service here is second to none in the evenings. We felt so well looked after. The food is also fabulous. We all had fillet - some with the prawns, another with half a lobster and one just on it's own. The steaks were all perfectly cooked. The prawns and lobster were delicious. Unfortunately all the fries were overcooked considerably. Perhaps due to it being after 9pm. In any event, that was reported to the staff who immediately swapped them for fresh, lovely fries.This place is quite expensive but well worth it.",1

2371,tripadvisor,eng,1,experience,I love the lively atmosphere at Seafood Bar and visited twice in three days.  Service was excellent.  Fresh seafood!  My family really liked the grilled cod and lobster.  Fried fish and fries were a little greasy- my only complaint.,1

The bartender was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, we had a great time speaking with him and he gave us great recommendations for the rest of our trip.We‚Äôd like to come back another time and eat a full meal here as it looked delicious and was packed.

2377,tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;reputation,"The food is excellent here.  Very fresh and well prepared and presented. Good sized portions.  Its very crowded with both locals and tourists, as the word is out that this is the place to go and be seen.  Its a bit noisy and the pace is franetic, but the servers do not rush you.  Its just not a quiet, relaxed place. Make reservations well in advance.",1
2379,tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food,"We ate there two times in two days.  It was that great!    First day we shared the fish and shell fish platter.   A lot of tasty seafood.   The next day my wife had the fish of the day and I had the Dover sole.  A waitress willingly deboned both fish dishes and arranged it beautiful.   If you like fish,lots of choices, you need to go.   5 star.",1
2389,tripadvisor,eng,1,food;service;environment,"After a very exhausting and long day, we were looking for a place like this for a food like they offer. It was instantly a match made in heaven and maybe this isn't an objective review as it perfectly fitted to our expectations.Didn't try much - two type of burgers, salad, ""les frites"" and some drinks - and nothing stayed behind! Can't give any further evidence. For our mood that night and for Leuven's central zone, it was exactly what we've needed and we've enjoyed each single bite.",1

A place we will go back to during our trip and make time for in the future.As a vegan my family (wife + toddler) is always on the lookout for good food with more choice than a single dish. And when we find a place like Greenway with the entire menu being vegan, you have hit a jackpot.The food from here is great, we had the black bean burger, Thai curry with rice and their souo of the day. The burger is a must have and their Thai curry was delicious. My toddler drank up the soup in no time and wanted more. Their vegetable and fruit juice was good and they have plenty of dessert options.On top of this, the service is excellent! Very courteous staff/owners. When my toddler threw a tantrum, she was given toys that had her mesmerized and us relieved. It was most unexpected and we were pleasantly surprised.I would highly recommend visiting this place if you are a vegan or not. Great food, fabulous service and convenient location.",1

For burritos, choose between a flour, whole wheat or spinach tortilla. 2 kinds of chicken, Chipotle marinated or Buffalo, o had the former. Excellent value got a major airport for court.",1
3938,yelp,eng,1,experience;service;food,"This time around I had a 5 star experience.. legit was happier to order.. I got a burrito this time and it tasted 10x better than it normally would because it was free thanks to the ppl at Dos Toros listening to my complaint on their other location. They gave me a cool card that allowed me a free meal. Aside from it being free the service was extremely better.. now I can give it the credit it should get... I know last time I said I wouldn't come back but they made up for that visit.. I'd gladly return... (Coronas are only $5 here too sooooooo... yeah, I'll be back)",-1
3939,yelp,eng,1,value,"These burritos were a generous size. I ordered the Cabo shrimp burrito. While the burrito was hefty and full of rice, beans and whatever else I added, I found myself wishing there was more meat. A combo burrito might have been nice instead. They do warn you of the 4 minute wait to grill up the shrimp, and it was still a very quick turnaround to get my food. My tortilla held together well with only a little bit of dripping. The foil wrapper kept it all from spilling all over me. I would make sure you're ready with what you want to order. They didn't really ask me what kind of tortilla I wanted, so I got the regular instead of the wheat. Then they started calling out several choices very quickly, so be ready to make several fast decisions so you don't feel the pressure of holding up the line. Also make sure to tell them what you want even if they don't call it out. They didn't call out the veggies or the quinoa for me, which was fine, but there was some other mixture next to it that I might have wanted. Of course, it probably would have made my burrito soggy, so probably for the best.",-1

But My baja chicken burrito at Burrito Beach was excellent. Tasty, fresh, and efficiently made to order. Portion was large enough for left overs, all at a very reasonable price. I wouldn't hesitate to stop in again the next time I'm at O'Hare.",1

I don't think their prices are too bad to either my burrito is about $8.29 for the burrito. You have a choice of tacos, toast burrito, rice bowl, nachos or crispy quesadillas. I liked the beans and rice with the burrito and mild salsa was tasty. I say check it out I like it. I would totally have it again if I was at the Northwestern building heading to some doctor's appointment and wanted a bite to eat.",1

When we were here just after a procedure just this morning, my wife is allergic to onions and he offered to cut and give her just a plain half of an avocado.

Always exciting to go to a gourmet burger restaurant and seeing what sort of special burgers are available! I ended up with the Guaco Waco Lamb burger which came looking a bit dry but was quite tasty! There were some condiments on the table (ketchup and  tabasco sauces) to help elevate the flavours if necessary. The sweet potato fries were good too and the better option to the plain fries, in my opinion.Ambience - The restaurant is quite nicely decorated; chequered tiles, motifs on the walls and has some influence of an American deli. It‚Äôs not quite cosy and is quite a long and narrow space. There are sitting areas outside but be mindful that people do smoke!Accessibility - The outside areas are accessible but there are steps leading into the restaurant and going towards the back dining area. Space is also quite tight.Cost - It‚Äôs slightly more expensive to experience the gourmet burgers if you do like your non-standard burgers, it‚Äôs certainly worth a stop to try them out!Service - Staff were friendly and helpful; we were sat outside and when the weather made a turn for the worse and they quickly moved our dishes to an available table inside.",1

We had the Kenny Phoenix mix of sauces and added meatballs and it was so so good. -The staff were friendly and fast; the menu is customizable. You can choose your personal mix of pasta and sauce and toppings. You can choose a size based on how hungry you are (we shared a ""horse"").-This particular location has a romantic terrace which is a lovely place to watch the sunset.

5413,google_mybusiness,eng,1,reputation;food;service,"One of the finest burger places at the Belgian coast.Located at the seafront it's absolutely great to watch the sun set and enjoy a great burger with a great beach side atmosphere.The menu caters to both carnivores, vegetarians and vegans. The menu also has a small selection for kids.With each burger the menu offers a helpful  selection of recommended beers. Burger prices are very steep if compared to prices at  a golden arches fast food chain, but you get much more than the tasteless bun and third grade meat. Here buns are  premium bread and sizeable, and the burgers, both meat and non meat versions are distinguishably of a premium quality. The burger itself is accompanied by a jar of mayolike based apple and other vegetable mix- interesting concept. This might not be to everyone's liking though- as the traditional way of serving burgers in Belgian would be with a larger salad and fries- at a comparable price. If you want fries, they cost  extra, but worth it-though one portion per two people would for most people be enough (large hand cut , baked in grease, yet not over-greasy and perfectly crunchy and soft in all the right places).As to drinks, as mentioned they have a very satisfying selection of beers that are matched with the burgers, as well as tasty home made jar served lemonades.Places fill up quickly on sunny evenings so come early or call ahead. Service is generally friendly and accommodating, however...On the down side, every single table around us was served a wrong order.  Clearly the order system, though seemingly  hi-tech with mobile devices and special buzzing watches, was no match for the sunny summer evening crowd. Double check your bill when paying as we did not receive all the orders we made, yet were charged for them. The non-supplied orders were deducted once pointed out, as was the case with the people around us.When leaving I was stopped non-discretely at the exit and asked whether I had not forgotten to pay,  by the same waiter I had paid to at the cash register five minutes earlier. Again, after a verification in the system, a technical mistake apparently- though a waiter should at least remember a paying client's face for more than five minutes... Order mixups, being billed for non delivered food, being stopped  from leaving in public and asked to pay when one has just paid to the same waiter- these are all mistakes which should not occur in an establishment which clearly has put in effort to bring  an impressive menu with quality food in an otherwise pleasant setting to those willing to pay premium prices for premium food.Despite the downsides, definitely a place I will be revisiting with my colleagues and friends, and hopefully this time without the technical and human glitches in the system...",-1

They were light and crispy, the way you want them on a nice spring day 1.75/2.0The sauce is boss- this sauce is for all you hot as spicy fans, it was definitely on the hotter side of the spice but still was nice, didn‚Äôt overpower the pickle, tiny knock for the heat, but bearable for the spice-sensitive crowd 0.45/0.50The display- just look at that display and tell me it‚Äôs not perfect, yah got the basket tipped over with pickles pouring onto the plate, just fighting to be the first one picked up, and even comes with a cute little garnishment to color it up, perfect score here 0.50/0.50In conclusion we have an extremely good rating for some fantastic pickles.

Although there are 15 small bowls of different dishes, there are no focuses. Three or four dishes have a few peaces of meat, which is a pity because the portion (considered as main course) is simply too little, even for starter!My advice? You do not need 15 dishes. Less is fine as long as each dish is (quantitative) large enough for enjoying it. So people remember/impressed by what they eat.",-1

It was absolutely a seafood feast!We went on a Friday for dinner and it was very busy with both tourists and locals. Luckily we were able to grab two seats at the bar. So make a reservation to secure a table if you go. We ordered a combination for two with both hot and cold seafood and we were very happy with our choice. We were amazed with the food amount and variety. For a similar meal in NYC, you'd looking to chipping in at least 150 bucks before taxes and tips. The combination was well worth it and you got to taste the best of both worlds. Between the two of us, we got to share a whole lobster (half chilled, half hot saut√©ed), two types of fish (one filet and one whole), tons of mussels, clams (including my favorite razor clams too!), shrimps, oysters, crabs, calamari, etc. Literally anything seafood you could think of were presented. And the menu is so flexible that you can mix and match to get different combinations to satisfy your appetite. Everything was super fresh and top notch quality. We especially enjoyed shell fishes such as mussels and clams. For the mussels back home in the US, I could not think of any other cooking method than boiling them in white wine to remove the fishy taste. Oh man, the mussels over here were simply steamed and chilled, but did not taste fishy at all. It was in fact so clean and sweet.

Large, highly place stained glass windows make for a amazingly airy room and in daylight it is bright. The seating is well arranged with plenty of space between tables to move and several banks of plush booth seats. We, a party of three (two adults and a young child) arrived and chose from the ¬£7.95 two course set menu meal. Complentary water was immediately served and upon onced ordered starters arrived promptly - followed by main course which arrived shortly after. Although the portions were small the food was of good and tasty. Looking through the main menu, it was quite large and detailed but dishes averaged somewhere around ¬£12-15 per person - not unreasonable considering the quality of what we recieved on a set menu. Our grumble with this restuarant was the poor service we recieved from the waiting staff. Although attentive to our daughters experience, they ignored both of us adults. I asked for drink at the start of the meal and didn't recieve it until I had asked for it twice and was then given the wrong drink (given how long I had waited for it in the first place, I didn't want to risk being forgotten again) - this was then followed by us not being offered dessert by anybody, which at the time we wanted, but once again decided not to bother for risk of being forgotten again. Then, we tried to get the bill, I think we waited about 10 minutes for a waiter to notice we were waiting for the bill and then the card machine.

We only ate main courses.The 12oz ribeye was a fantastic piece of meat and cooked really well and well seasoned. The sweet potato fries and onion rings excellent. The mushroom was as bad as the meat was good - cold, rubbery, flavourless.Service was fine and friendly and the restaurant was quiet as you would expect for a Monday evening. There was a small group of folks who came in and sat down behind the bar, who seemed to know some of the staff. One of them was either drunk or ill brought up as he kept shouting out and making noise although I did see one of the staff ask him to be quiet.

A couple tried to come in about 10 minutes after me and they were told they were closed. I was sitting up front and could hear them. I was rather surprised that they closed so early being right next to the theater district on a Friday night in general. The food was average/ok. I didn't eat any other Italian food while I was in London, so unsure of the standard. The server was also a little neutral toward me when I got there. As I ordered quickly and I think he realized I wasn't going to linger, he warmed up a lot and was very nice. The service was fast and good.

Neighbouring table arrived after us, had complimentary water provided, normal drinks and ordered starters before we were even attended too.The waiter stunk of garlic but took our order. We till got no complimentary water as every other table did.The starters came but we had no forks on the table so they had to get us some to start eating.

(Another 5 mins of listening to our next door neighbour talking about where she bought her outfit from in great detail)We got dessert which was tiny portion banoffee. The sundae wasn't partocularlu nice just plain ice cream, 2 pieces of brownie and some cream that tasted odd like it was over whipped.but for price fine.When the waiter returned we asked for bill. 5 mins later he came back to another table nearby and said oh I forgot your bill. By this time my partner had had enough and went to till to pay where the same waiter got sharp as my partner refused to agree to the tip on the machine. when my partner told him he felt the service was poor he argued a little rather than apologise.This was a massive let down as otherwise I would be raving about the value for money and would want to try a normal menu meal but afraid one staff member has made our first experience not a very good one. :-(",-1

The bruschetta avacado was basically green goop on toast with a few seeds on top -visually off putting - my wife and I exchange glances and she whispered 'are you really going to eat that?' (I ate some of it). The prawn cocktail was straight out of a classic 70's dinner party but very tasty. The salmon was good but the chicken was dry (overcooked) and the tomato/basil base it was in looked suspiciously like it was out of a can but it was fairly tasty so overall OK.  My daughters both had margherita pizzas, one pizza had very little cheese topping and one was ok (if an Italian restaurant can't get a margherita pizza right you know it's not good). Nearly forgot about the side dish of rosemary potatoes - turned up luke-warm and limp and very quickly turned to cold mush (no one had more than a forkful before politely declining a second). Thank god they couldn't mess up the profiteroles,the ice cream or the coffee (but they did forget my wife's latte), however, the people who had tiramisu were disappointed and several were left unfinishedLots of food left over which the waiter scrapped into a bin behind the counter before sending empty plates back to the kitchen (does the chef know how much is thrown away?).The waiter was very friendly and personable and his humour made up for an otherwise generally forgettable meal.Sure Spaghetti House could do better",-1

This young lady was unable to answer any questions regarding the menus or the dishes and also kept forgetting to bring other things out which we‚Äôd asked for, causing us to have to ask several times for the same thing as we were conscious that we were on a time limit due to the show we‚Äôd booked to see.

We were given a menu and then waited quite some time before our order was taken and that was only because I asked the waitress if we were supposed to go up and order because it had been so long. Our food didn't take too long to come after that, we ordered a burger which was very good, sweet potato fries which were pretty standard and onion ring that were also pretty standard. We also ordered the chicken wings which were good and came with a nice sauce. You pay at the till as you leave so don't sit around waiting for them to get you your bill.

Food was brought very rapidly, so we were out in just over an hour (we weren't rushed though, and did not have dessert). Although the Lemongrass Saison beer I had was delicious, as was my companion's (heavily iced) lime soda, the same could not be said of the food. We started with the corn kachumber which tasted like sweetcorn in a mildly spiced gloopy sauce, and moved on to the smoked mackerel, which was like supermarket pate bulked out with a light mayonnaise, followed by the bhel puri which didn't tast of mango at all - one just experienced the smooth texture of the creamy topping and the crunchiness of everything underneath. Finally the garlic and coriander stem (just like a supermarket naan) came with two overcooked lamb chops my partner (who loves lamb chops) could not finish one and donated it to me - as I am less of a connoisseur of this dish I finished most of it.

There was not any passion in the food the were serving.The staff were like robbots, correct in their procedure but not friendly at all. When the waiter presented the lasagna, he asked if i would like cheese, however this was reflected in a way that looked forced and robotic, without interest or genuine care. after providing the cheese, I felt almost intimidated to ask for more, as the tone of voice and body language of the waiter was far from friendly.Feel free to see for yourself and determine if you can relate to my experience. A seemingly enjoyable lunch can turn out to be an overpriced mistake.Regards",-1

Instead of offering something as a compensation, they instead gave us a bill for our 2 Drinks and didn't Retake an order for our Food.If someone came to our table, apologised for the unconvenience and offered to take an order with a discounted Price or the nachos for free or whatever, it would have been ok and we still would have eaten our burgers without much complaining...I can only rate the Service and the Service is the most miserable I have ever witnessed in a Restaurant... They were completly overwhelmed and the Restaurant was maybe half full during lunch time.. They forgot orders left and right and they dropped Food, which spilled on the customers. They just gave him a dry kitchen  towel to clean off hot dipping Sauce or chili that has been spilled all over his clothes by one of the Services..Would never recommend anyone to waste their time there, Ostende has so many nice Restaurants to offer! Take a look at them instead!!",-1

I give it 2 stars today only because of the waiting staff , who are really working hard and doing their best, otherwise this place  doesn‚Äôt deserve even 1 star. And the reason for that - food and toilets .  In all honesty McDonald‚Äôs burgers are much more value for money and definitely better taste. Steak - hardly chewable and this is in the place positioning themselves as steak house . Toilets - separate issue , the cherry on the top , no idea why they opted in for unisex toilets , but the picture of male guests peeing with open doors did not appeal to me at all and made me feel extremely uncomfortable to use the toilet . How such toilets can be suitable for children ?? We definitely will not be coming back.",-1

One of our party opted for the battered fish.We expected fine slices of the roasts but what was served up looked more like a meat stew, impossible to tell quite what it was. It turned out to be fatty meat, difficult to cut and even worse to eat and you just could not tell which was beef and which was lamb.50% + was inedible and left. The fish course was so undercooked the batter was soggy inside and the fish just not cooked.All in a disappointing experience.

The waiter not only refused to give us tap water but also, when we asked about the reason behind this, she was rude to us and treated us badly. If the restaurant refuses to give clients tap water, the least they can do is offer an explanation in a respectful way. We felt disrespected as people and as clients.

We were sat on a table the other side of an open partition to their order screen where staff would chat, but this had the effect of interrupting our conversations and we often thought someone was talking to us when they weren‚Äôt. Poor design on the restaurants part. The food was mediocre and disappointing. Starters were good, however on ordering steaks rare to blue, only one came that way. Mine was definitely medium to well done. The ribs were not as tender as expected and the sauce seemed undercooked which meant it was slightly tart.

Cold plates, cold grey looking steaks and very very small potions of lobster, in fact mine was all shell with two small mouth fulls of lobster!The mixed grill was also cold and grey!   To be fair, we complained and the complaint was dealt with in a very professional manner, we chose to eat the food as we were so hungry and could not face another long wait and the young lady, the manageress I assume did take money off the bill.The management need to look at the amount of customers the kitchen and wait staff are serving at any one time, because last night they could not cope !!

The downstairs seating with the metal partition has clearly been designed to cram as many people as possible into the restaurant, to the detriment of the customer (it's more spacious in McDonalds). I even go to the lengths of requesting NOT to sit there when booking a table, however my request was ignored when we last visited.My partner and I had the unfortunate mis-pleasure of being seated next to the partition/another couple on Saturday evening. It was like sitting on a table of four with two other people we did not know. I couldn't even hear my partner talking to me from across the table as all I could hear was the people squeezed next to us.We considered leaving the restaurant at this point as it was so intrusive, but we were there for a Birthday meal which we didn't want to be ruined so persevered. Unfortunately the last straw came when I was hit with mucus from the gentleman next to me blowing his nose (yes, the seats are THAT close!). We asked to be seated elsewhere in the restaurant and the staff obliged after a 10 minute wait.We thought the unpleasantness would then be over and we could enjoy the meal. Ordering was smooth, however we still did not have our food after a 45 minute wait. Other customers who has been seated and ordered after us were receiving food before us. Sadly when the food arrived my ""medium"" fillet steak was so burnt I had to scrape charcoal off the top of it and my mushroom and tomato was stone cold. My partner's chicken was also burnt to a crisp.By this point we'd had enough of being in the restaurant and just wanted to get out, so we left as soon as possible.Thanks for ruining our Birthday celebrations Middletons.

Still no one arrived to take our order, so we tried asking again - this time a different member of staff. His response was not what we had expected. He told us he was not going to take our order; that the kitchen could not cope; the bar could not cope and that ‚Äúthis was bad for us....‚Äù He was rude, unapologetic and simply waited for us to leave.

Two tables of two finished whilst we were ordering and a table of four arrived whilst we were waiting for our food. There was a large dirty table next to us which remained uncleared for the duration of our visit. My husband ordered the Middletons Burger, without the bun, which comes with salad instead along with fries. When it came it had sweet potato fries, which had to be exchanged. The salad was a lettuce wedge and a piece of tomato! I ordered the fillet steak with jacket potato, cooked rare. My steak had to go back as it was still breathing and the tiny jacket potato was still hard, it could not be mashed! Extremely poor. No excuses as the restaurant was empty.

Middletons clearly doesn‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs customers know or care about food and doesn‚Äôt think twice about deceiving them. No good restaurant would have margarine anywhere in the building. The steak had been rubbed with some sort of oil and drenched in salt. OTOH my friend ate her burger and chips very happily. This would be zero marks but for our lovely waiter, Peter, who was everything you want a waiter to be: charming and genuinely interested in us having an enjoyable meal.

The sauce lacked seasoning and was basically bulked up with such a ridiculous amount of mushrooms, it just wasn‚Äôt funny.Charging ¬£8 for a bottle of. beer, also wasn‚Äôt funny.When the waitress came over to see if all was ok, I told her that yes, although the pizza was fine, it was overpriced as you just don‚Äôt get much of it. She told me that it‚Äôs half a pizza and the regular size costs ¬£10......which begs the question, if it‚Äôs half, why are you charging me ¬£8 instead of ¬£5 I explained that I wasn‚Äôt complaining, it was merely my point of few. The manger then came over (whilst I was still trying to eat) and enquired about the ‚Äòcomplaint‚Äô so, I had to explain again, that in my opinion you‚Äôre charging quite a lot for very little.What‚Äôs the point?I should‚Äôve just gone to Pizza Express",-1

I chose mussels as a starter & the Prime Middletons mixed grill with a side salad. The mussels were pretty good, a nice albeit standard sauce. Only a few dead ones which is good. The sauce was finished with the bread. The mixed grill arrived & was good in parts. The steak was OK but well done not medium. The chicken was good & the ribs were tasty.

I had bbq ribs, and they were very nice and sticky - thankfully the excellent hand wipes were in ample supply. We then had to wait ages for our mains and no one came to ask us if we wanted more drinks, even though all our glasses were empty. When mains finally arrived the food was generally very nice. Only issue with my mixed grill was the steak was well undercooked. Asked for medium and it was quite rare. Didn't have time for dessert due to my taxi being booked for 9:30 (thinking 2.5 hours would be ample for dinner). So food generally very good but service not so good.",-1

Both our steaks were as chewy as you can imagine and the price for all this was not at all worth the money!

Then I had ordered lemon posit, a plate was ""plonked"" in front of me with a small circle of cheesecake on a large plate, no sauce or decoration whatsoever. I couldn't believe my eyes especially as this wasn't what I expected and definitely not worth  the ¬£5.25 I was charged for it. All the people I was sitting with were underwhelmed with their meals with one complaining to the staff saying how bad the meal and service had been and we would certainly not be paying the service charge!

If you‚Äôre going to serve wine, you need to be able to, you know, serve wine!  Burgers were ok,cooked to a lovely medium pink but not at all flavourful.  The Ellis classic was bland; the meatlover good.  The sweet potato fries were also tasteless - maybe this is a new world vegetable?  And both sauces were inappropriate.  Chipotle mayo is the norm in Canada and I‚Äôd recommend it here too!Overall, this was very overpriced, underwhelming, and substandard service.  Try elsewhere.",0

It‚Äôs a steakhouse so we went for steak and to be fair that was the only good thing served on the cold plates. It was only partly saved at the end by the waiter not charging us for the awful steak sauces (we both choose different but standard ones and neither tasted like they should have) and a poor side. From reading the reviews it sounds like we were unlucky with the chef that was on the night we were there, but at fairly fully priced small portions the quality and consistency needs to be improved, so not worth chancing it.",-1

Well for me it was truly a disappointment, Whilst my wife and granddaughter said their meal was okay, mine was definitely not. I decided on the fish with crushed peas and chips.  My fish was warm and sloppily wet. not moist as it should have been but wet. The batter was cooked so I can only assume that the fish was frozen and the fat to hot. So the batter cooked and the fish was warm and just defrosted. As for the peas, well it was a tiny pot and it held if I was lucky a desert spoon of crushed peas. Why are peas crushed? Are they afraid they may roll of the plate, or is this a new trendy way to serve them.  Whilst the chips were nice the meal as a whole was not, and they charged over 11 pounds for that. shall not bother to visit them again. I would get 100 times better in the local chip shop.",-1

My wife had the Nut 'Roast' which she says tasted like it had been deep fried. Veg were average with very floppy roast parsnips and cauliflower cheese that hadn't seen the grill for long enough.

Due to the slow nature of the service no one came to ask about it for quite some time and I wasn't going to make the fuss of running around looking for someone. By the time I could make my issue my partner had almost finished his meal so when asked if I wanted anything else it seemed quite redundant to get a replacement and eat separately.

The wait staff were rushed off their feet but food just wasn't coming out of the kitchen quickly enough. One hour wait for starter and nearly another hour til the main for a lunch set menu isn't good enough and you wouldn't expect to be seated for this long. Once the food came it was great, between us we had garlic mushrooms, pate, haddock goujons and chicken wings and all were great. Mains of minute steak, steak ciabatta and burger were all very good and cooked as requested. Peterborough tends to be busy on a Saturday lunch time and added to this there was a large concert at the football stadium, and it just looked like they hadn't planned for it. We were offered a small discount on the food on the bill which was appreciated but to be in a restaurant for approx 2.5 hours for a set lunch is about double what you'd expect.

So let's start - Service was fine, not particularly attentive or pro-active but fine for a Sunday. Atmosphere... I had to double-check I was in a restaurant - it was fullish but about as dead as the beef I was about to suffer through. The beef was almost comically tough, like a leather placeholder had been served as though they'd forgotten to cook enough for service. I waited 5 minutes for the sides only to realise that they were already on my plate! A pound coin-sized serving of each served as a sample to the flavourless combinations that might actually be full dishes for any lucky punter visiting on a regular service day - for this, I count myself lucky that I only had to taste, rather than eat, the apparent 'side' for my meal. To top it off, it was cold - zero f**ks were given and zero enjoyment was had. I didn't complain on the day but I should've. Maybe the small plates and regular a la carte are more their thing - Sorry guys, but I'll never know. Service 3/5. Food 0.5/5. No atmosphere.p.s.

We were casually told there was a 'problem in the kitchen' and our food would arrive in 5 minutes' time. When our food eventually arrived it was stone cold and when we asked for it to be warmed we were coldly told 'I don't have time to deal with you' from one member of staff and then another said we could have our food microwaved. We eventually left because our second round of drinks didn't even arrive and by that time we had waited over an hour for food. The staff weren't fussed and watched us walk away. I would not recommend this place it's a complete joke and the service is the worst I have ever received. Please avoid.,-1

Starters arrived no problem, when the mains arrived the seafood mixed grill I had ordered contained calamari which looked like it had spent a week in the fryer. The waiters couldn't work out which cut of steak was which nor how it had been asked for (rare, medium, well done). My pregnant wife's steak which she had asked to come medium was dripping with blood and my friends meal arrived 15 minutes later only after I prompted the waiter. My wife sent her rare cold steak back and when it arrived back it was still rare and dripping in oil. We spoke to the manager and we were told they would take my wife's steak off the bill, which should have been given as she couldn't eat it. That was it, an entire evening ruined which left everyone annoyed and dissatisfied.",-1

We counted 6 employees. 2 laying down in one of the stalls inside, another seated nearby with his cellphone, another 2 outside seated smoking and one young woman who we spotted walking around once or twice. When I dragged one of the employees to the counter to pay my bill I found out a dish that is listed as 13,00‚Ç¨ for 2 people to share on the menu was actually per person. This was not stated on the menu and our server neglected to mention this while taking our order. That chicken was definitely mediocre at best and in no way worth the price.

There was no atmosphere as I think everyone else was aware that we where all practically huddled together. It felt like a dining hall. The food wasn‚Äôt great. I ordered calzone. The filling was very small 2/3 of the dough was just that dough with no filling in it at all and it was gooey and not piping hot. I‚Äôve had better at Frankie and Bennys.

I completely understand reasturants adding this when there is a party of 6+ but when there are only 3 of you this is a problem. When we asked for the service charge to be taken off the bill the waitress seemed shocked and asked why. What ever happened to tipping afterwards?",-1
1040,tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;service,"Pre booked lunch for 15 people. Arrived on time for our 12.30 table booking, place wasn't particularly full, maybe 5 or 6 tables of people. Took 15 minutes to take a drinks order and managed to miss someone. Starters (only 2 people out of the 15) arrived after about 25 mins and looked small but were part of the meal deal so OK I guess. After an hour of waiting for the mains, we were told our food was coming after we asked (not one of the waiters had come to let us know they were having trouble, or were busy etc) and was on the pass, only for that food to be taken to another table. Our food finally came out an hour and 10 minutes after we had arrived. The two fish mains were sent back to the kitchen as inedible as the fish was so over cooked as was a butterfly piripiri chicken. Some of the mains were advertised as ""All individual steaks are garnished with field mushroom, crushed garden peas & roast tomato"", no mushrooms, peas were to be seen and an uncooked half tomato was the only garnish on the plate.Two steaks were sent back to the kitchen to be cooked further as despite being ordered medium well done and medium, both were far too rare. These were then brought back to the table without any of the sides that had been on them plates sent back, and when queried a couple of portions of greasy fries were sent out along with another uncooked tomato half.Several of the group had ordered a 3 course meal and the desserts which arrived again took forever to arrive and were of measly proportions. I certainly wouldn't have paid full price for them but as part of the meal deal I guess it was OK value. Again I didn't have one so can't comment on the taste.It's the first time personally I've been there, and would never return. Shame, as the d√©cor and the idea seems good, the execution of it however is just dire and having a waitress roll her eyes when asked why it was taking so long having prebooked and reply ""we had other people come in at the same time""...Wow. No restaurant has ever faced people wanting Lunch at Lunchtime before...",-1
1075,tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;service,"As you can imagine from the title, this will not be the most favourable review of a business, particularly one that I had previously heard raved about in both business and social circles. As part of a large group, and as a goodbye lunch for a colleague, our lunch was pre-booked many days in advance, however the organisation we were met with certainly left a lot to be desired.First, i'll start with the positives, there being very few from our trip. The aesthetics of the restaurant are very attractive, a far cry from the drudgy old bank that used to reside. We were not greeted by anyone immediately as we entered, however we were seated relatively swiftly, with perhaps 5 or so other tables of diners in occupation.Now we move on to where things fall downhill. Rapidly. (Or not depending on your interpretation of irony). Once seated, it was perhaps a good 15, maybe 20 minutes before our drinks orders were taken, where I was subsequently entirely ignored by the server, having to catch him on his way back with the drinks some time later. Fast forward another 10-15 minutes and the two (yes, two, out of 15) of our party that ordered starters were finally approached with their food. I believe it was fish goujons, and chicken wings, both small portions but as part of the three-course-deal this was not considered a major issue. Now we shall fast forward again, perhaps a further 30 minutes give or take, where we were now having to chase up with the staff where our main courses were, to be advised that they were in final preparation and would be with us shortly, the waiter even gesturing to the dishes being plated up in the serving area visible.Now, as a large group of now very hungry guests, it was particularly demoralising to then see said dishes be served to other guests, with no sign of ours making their way to the front of house. A further ten minutes pass, and we see more dishes begin to materialise, could it be ours? Thankfully yes, and the waiter began passing the food among our guests, great - the food is here, and our mood is lifted. Or is it?Now, let's cut to the chase. Three mains (including my own) were sent back to the kitchen, in all honesty - effectively inedible, a seabass main, a fish grill main, and a butterfly chicken main. I cannot say that I have ever had to vigorously chew a seabass fillet before, and I did not particularly enjoy doing so here. Along with these three plates of sorrow, two further dishes were returned to the kitchen, although this time to be actually cooked:As a specialist steak restaurant, we found it particularly gobsmacking, that two steak orders, one medium-rare and one medium-well, were practically still mooing on the plate. Upon return, whilst still not perfect the dishes were edible, though missing any of the sides they were sent back with until this was queried. The remaining guests reported good to average meals in fairness, though did comment that overcooking was a common theme, as was small portion sizes.The same two guests who ordered starters later (by later - this whilst the discussion was being had over what would make it to the bill, where we did have to check that the desserts actually still existed) received the 3rd course of their set - the pavlova, which again were very small though one would imagine this is why they are in the three-course-deal in the first place. As far as taste I believe there was no concern with these.As we near the end of this wonderous afternoon of wasted time and now for me at least, stomach grumbling hunger, it came time to pay the bill. Upon questioning the waitress as to the significant delays given our pre-booking, the rude delivery of the as ever pathetic excuse along the lines of  'we had a number of other guests to attend to' left a sour taste in my mouth - the only taste I had in my mouth I will reiterate.In all, a pre-booked lunch took the best part of 2-hours to suffer through, with inedible food, inattentive staff, and no apology in sight. The three returned dishes were removed from the bill and the remaining group settled up. So will I ever return here personally? No, I shall not, nor will I be shy about giving my thoughts on our visit whenever pertinent.I am certainly no expert in running a business, however can I perhaps suggest that if there is going to be a wait, you may wish to inform your guests of this, rather than hide from sight or fob them off, and if heaven forbid things do go poorly, you may wish to consider an apology as a way to soften the blow. Who knows, maybe this review wouldn't have taken as long as one of your meals in that case.",-1

The waiter didn't indicate the price of the special when he knew this was for my son (this was ¬£22!), nor did he indicate that this was very spicy, so most of it was uneaten.

When I called the waitress she stood looking at it, saying,oh that's funny, where's the sauce? That's what I wanted to know?

When we arrived, our reserved table was a table for four with an extra chair at the end of one of the tables.  That was ridiculous for five people as there simply wouldn't have been room for the fifth plate so we asked for a different table which, as the restaurant wasn't busy, wasn't an issue luckily.The waitress then wanted to take our order a matter of minutes after we'd been seated and given the menus - we were still reading the menu so asked her to come back.  Of course, when we had all chosen what we wanted, we couldn't find anyone to take the order!!We ordered a couple of starters to share between the table - crescentine and pane all aglio - both were fine, if a little greasy.For the main courses we ordered 2 x maccheroni pesto rosso, 1 tortelloni di asparagi, 1 x linguine alle vongole and 1 lasagne pasticciate - all were fine, nothing special.For dessert we ordered 1 pizza nutella to share between two, 1 tiramisu, 1 affogato and 1 caffe goloso with the chocolate brownie - this was probably the best course.What we were really annoyed about - but didn't know until the bill was presented - was that we had ordered a bottle of house wine and were told house wine only came in a carafe which we were then charged ¬£26.95 for.  When I looked on the website afterwards, it clearly states that the bottle of house wine costs ¬£11.90 - we were ripped off to the tune of ¬£15.05 which is completely disgraceful.Obviously the staff are trained to up-sell on the drinks but it is completely dishonest to tell them to tell the customer that the only option for house wine is a carafe (which we weren't told the cost of and would never have guessed it would have been anywhere near the ¬£26.95 charge) when a bottle of house wine is actually ¬£11.90.A 12.5% service charge was also added - this amounted to ¬£15.48 - the service wasn't good and possibly the reason why is because the servers know they're going to get the tips anyway.So, our bill came to ¬£139.28 - this did not represent good value for what we received and, as previously stated, because we were totally ripped off with the wine, it's left a very bad taste in our mouth.",-1

For some context and better understanding, the restaurant is located in Place Jourdan best known in Brussels for its Maison Antoine located the middle of the square which is one of the 2 oldest friteries priding with the best you can eat Belgian fries. There is an unwritten rule that you can serve the fries on all the terraces while ordering beer or something from the restaurants. This being said, we were 2 persons, I went to buy the fries (there are very long waiting ques usually) and my companion took a seat on the terrace of Ellis to order burgers and some drinks - important to mention that we talk about the terrace located in the middle of the square, across the road and not the terrace located on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant. Upon my return, drinks were already served and in less than 5 minutes a server brings the burgers. Seeing that we had the fries from Maison Antoine, he kindly informs us of the policy of Ellis that they don't allow their customers to buy and consume fries from somewhere else but as the burgers are served he is kind enough to make a joke and agrees to make an exception this time. Less than 5 minutes and the manager arrives informing us she is in charge and despite having the approval of her colleague waiter, we have to pack our fries in order to continue eating. Needless to say we were both enjoying the burgers up to that moment which lasted for another 5 minutes of intense debate during which we acknowledged the strict policy of the restaurant but as we were not informed before ordering, we asked to be left to finish our dinner in peace. Finally after several times asking, the lady visibly irritated by the fact that we did not agree to leave or pack our fries stormed out saying we'll pay a supplement. Of course our appetite was dead and asked for the check immediately. Having to pay inside by the counter (rule of the restaurant) I had to deal with the manager again as she tried to force me pay an extra amount of 3 Euros because not ordering fries from them with the threat that she will call the police if I don't agree.

1292,tripadvisor,eng,-1,service;food;value,"SUMMARY: I went with another person and the 2 thoughts that came to us were- this chicken has no soul- this chicken is dead for no reasonPLACE:they are well situated in a lively place just renovated, the inside is fine, although I found it not 100%clean, the waiter had to clean our table AFTER we were seated and the floor was not spotlessSERVICEwaiter and waitress were nice and efficient, although a bit too commercial, coming with repeated suggestions of extrasPRICEwe ended up with a bill of EUR 43 for 2 meals of chicken, 2 green salads and 2 side of potatoesFOOD, finallythis is exactly what I call a restaurant that assembles different food but doesn't cook. It's nicely served on the design side but not really a single touch of cooking, except maybe cutting oignon and cumcumber. We had half a chicken and tacos with grated chicken: I wonder how was my chicken grated as I has pieces instead. The sauce was of course industrial as was the salad dressing which was awful. The taste of the chicken is ...the taste of a mid-range chicken, really nothing exceptional. If you cook an organic chicken at home or a chicken that has the 'Label Rouge' (80 days breeding minimum), you definitely have a better taste.The supposedly potatoes cooked in the oven were not: they were boiled and then put in a pan to fry a bit. I mean, if you cook at home you cannot miss these details. The crunch of a potato in the oven was completely absent. Idem for the chicken seasoning/broth: if you do it at home yourself, you know how it tastes.Fries: they were also uninteresting: ok they have a special design and it's nice for the eye and....that's it: they were not crunchy at all, felt really industrial and had for some of them (enough to be noticed) potato black eyes. When you think the almost most famous frit-kot of Brussels is around the corner, the comparison doesn't resist.So in the end, the place feeds you with a certain price, you probably won't get sick, they serve quite swiftly, so if this is was you're looking for, go. For the rest, it unfortuanely felt like a good old marketing product surfing on a poshy placement on the market. Other places on the square are cheaper or equivalent in price and tastier.",-1

I didn't have high hopes because the quality of high street Italian chain restaurants is usually not good. However, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with my first two courses. My fried calamari starter was tasty and I have to say the spaghetti and meatballs I ordered for my main was really good - al dente spaghetti, good consistency sauce and hearty meatballs. Unfortunately, dessert was a big let-down because what was advertised as an apple tart didn't seem to have any hint of apples in it. Another let-down was the service. We were a group of four but my brother's starter didn't turn up until 20 minutes after the rest of us had been served and finished our starters, and this was only because we'd reminded the waiter it was missing - I'm convinced he'd forgotten about it and it wouldn't have arrived at all if we hadn't said something. It all also took an age for the bill to be brought to us, even though we'd asked for it twice. And whilst we're on the topic of money, I have to say I think this place is rather pricey for what you actually get.Because of the disappointing dessert and forgetful service I can't give this restaurant a higher score than average. My advice to readers would be to stick to a starter and a main only, and don't come here if you need to be somewhere afterwards in a hurry.",-1
1404,tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;service,"Visited last Sunday evening, party of four plus my seven-year old granddaughter. Not busy, with the number of other parties in the dining room just about covering off the fingers on one hand. Apart from the ladies in the hen group we thought we'd crashed a well attended meeting of those who'd voted for a certain former Peterborough MP in the recent by-election.I should say that my daughters' steaks were fine as was the bottle of Voignier (at twenty two quid), which for me was the high point of the visit. That's where the good bits end. Not being a fan of steak, after being advised that what I'd ordered first off had run out I settled for something else that looked interesting - the mushroon wellington from the veggie section of the menu. I was slightly bemused when I was asked how I'd like it cooked (well done etc). My wife ordered a spicy chicken dish. When the food finally got to the table I received what looked to be an imitation of a Greggs vegetable pasty and my wife's chicken was simply ""painted"". If you choose to forego the skin (as many do) what you're left with is, well, a piece of plain grilled chicken - no attempt made to score or marinade it although I can guess the reason for that. I suspect my ""wellington"" came out of a box delivered by a 3663 driver, Brake Bros, or whoever Middleton's use and went straight into the oven.After one of the kitchen staff had attempted to bend one in, and simply re-plated something that went back rather than replace it as I was promised (the bite I'd taken out of it was a bit of a clue), the  replacement arrived at about the same time as everyone else had finished. One of my daughters called for the desert menu and popped off to the ladies. When she returned a few minutes later, I asked her what she was going to order and she said ""I'm not going to bother. I don't think we should give this place any more of our money than we have to"". So apart from the little'un deserts were binned and my wife called for the bill.The DM removed the price of my main and knocked another tenner off for the impromptu rendition of Fawlty Towers. Despite this, the bill still clocked in at over a hundred quid and I could see my wife grimace as she handed over her credit card. She said later she resented having to pay every penny - which is no surprise bearing in mind the bill represents a week's earnings for her in her part-time job.Hey ho, lessons learned. One of the waiting staff did apologise profusely for the delays and the kitchen sending something back out that should have gone in the bin. I've never heard a waitress/waiter use the terms ""I'm taking ownership of this problem"" and ""representative of the company"" before on a dining floor, and I suspect both of these phrases can be found in the induction training manual for serving staff somewhere. I'm sure she was sincere, but regrettably such BS management phrases are usually lost on me (as I have to suffer many of them on a daily basis at work) and it just moved my patience gauge slightly further into the red. A simple ""sorry, we screw up sometimes"" would have sufficed.Yet another chain restaurant I think we'll be avoiding in the future. Sorry guys.",-1

The service was a little slow and the waiter was quite abrupt. Four out of the five meals arrived and were well presented and were lovely. The ceaser salad was delicious. My main concern about this restaurant was the attitude towards one of our parties food allergies. She ordered a salad that had goats cheese on it but asked to have it without the cheese as she is not able to eat dairy. The waiter bought the dish with the goats cheese and when it was pointed out it had been ordered without his response was - ‚Äòit is not much it won‚Äôt hurt you!‚Äô We thought he was joking and were quite shocked to find that he wasn‚Äôt!! In this day and age and with all the information available about allergies we were quite shocked. We eventually persuaded him to take it back and make another but it took so long she ended up eating on her own. Be careful if you visit and have a food allergy the food is good but it could be risky!! ,-1

Then when they brought the meals, she was not well understood which was each one so we asked what brings each as they were all similar but with different sauces and that bothered them. They gave us one wrong dish and we didn't even complain it. I asked her for an extra drink and she didn't even bring it until at the end I had to stop to tell her ! I asked you for a drink 10 minutes ago. Finally to pay the bill we asked her if we could pay separately, she answered again in a very disrespectful way!

My wife said that  the burger was quite ordinary and my pizza was the worst that I have had in a restaurant. Very leathery on a cold plate and I only ate half of it.

Three of us sat down at 7.35pm on a Wednesday night . We ordered drinks, nibbles and three pastas.The drinks and nibbles arrived reasonably quickly after about ten minutes but that was it. At 8.25 I asked the waitress where our food had got to and she went behind the bar, maybe to see the manager who wasn't there or look for the order , I don't know, then she ignored us completely, saying nothing . She started talking to another table's diners.The manager wasn't to be seen immediately although he was at the front of the restaurant talking to a customer.Another member of staff was approached by my wife and said he wasn't anything to do with the kitchen ( although he was a waiter) and frankly couldn't care less. I remonstrated with him to be told "" good night, go!"". I approached our waitress who studiously ignored me . I actually wanted to pay for the drinks we had had, but having been told to go already and having been ignored we just upped and left.This restaurant should be one of the jewels in the Crown for Spaghetti House being in a major tourist spot in London, only yards away from Piccadilly and Leicester Square. The service badly let the place down. I presume they had forgotten our order for some reason. However the place wasn't full and no explanation was offered. Other people who had come in maybe 20 minutes after us were served well before I complained.Having waited 50 minutes for three plates of pasta we were hungry and fed up. I appreciate the place will be full most of the time with unsuspecting tourists who won't know better but the Spaghetti House chain has lost one fan at least and we will never return. I have reviewed well over a hundred restaurants on Trip Advisor and this is the first time I have given only one star.A pity,",-1

Vapiano was the nearest walking distance Italian on TripAdvisor.The restaurant serves freshly prepared food for which you have to queue...it is a self service restaurant. The food is prepared at separate counters depending on whether you want a bowl of pasta, a pizza, a starter, a drink or lasagne (which is not served at the pasta counter but for some reason at the pizza counter...) BUT (and this is a big BUT)  there is nowhere any directions as to where you should queue and for what. So now you see why I suggest you dine alone and queue for one dish only. Otherwise you will spend another 20-30 minutes queueing again. Going there with a group expecting to eat together is impossible for different dishes are prepared at totally different speeds.We spent quite a while in there...queueing. The food was atrocious, the staff surly and uninterested, the bruchetta simply bread and tomatoes, the arrabiata bland and insipid and by the time my companion's pizza was ready we left it behind untouched and ran.By the way, you pay regardless whether the food is edible or not or whether you eat it or not.I suppose if you are hungry enough and stumble on this place by accident and it is the only place left open and you are alone, you way give a bowl of pasta a try. Otherwise avoid at all cost. Not only is it not worth going there, in my view, it is better to go hungry.",-1

Well they were friendly and that‚Äôs about all the nice things I can say. Now for the bad part. First of it‚Äôs expensive for the simple fact that they don‚Äôt cook your food they just plate it up. To start with I was served the salmondish. I handen it back and within a minute they came out with my pork. Not because they accidently had it readymade in the back but because that‚Äôs how long it takes to put on a plate. Now on to my dates salad. It lacken dressing so We asked for more. It was missing pears which We had to ask about and got the explanation that ‚Äùpears was out of season‚Äù. Ok? How about explaining it before We order the food.  You might think that with all those problems it was a packed place or busy. But there was only us and one more couple in the entire restaurant. And we were the only ones eating.

Their meals were exactly the same despite one ordering big kids and one ordering small kids. Neither liked their burgers as they tasted burnt so just ate the chips. Maybe this is because they are chargrilled but I imagine most kids would prefer a burger which didn't taste burnt. My beanburger and chips was fine but very basic, no side salad or anything, you would expect a bit more from a restaurant like this. The desserts were a shambles. One child ordered chocolate fudge brownie with no ice cream but it came with ice cream. One child ordered build your own banana split which was supposed to come with sprinkles, choc buttons and chopped strawberries according to the menu. What arrived was half a banana, cut in half with a lump of ice cream. We had to ask for the other things and were told they didn't do choc buttons any more. One adult ordered sticky toffee pudding and custard and received the tiniest toddler sized piece of pudding, with ice cream, not custard. The manager did take the kids meals off the bill but it was still disappointing. The other adult pudding was also tiny. Maybe they were small because we had the fixed price menu but they really were smaller than a child's portion.

As our mains, we ordered a simple pesto dish and a meatball dish. It was as if an entire jar of pesto had been added to the spaghetti and yet I still had to add pepper and salt as this dish was bland. The meatballs seemed a bit raw in the middle but when we checked with our server, she said that the kitchen said this was how it was cooked. Again, the dish was bland. We eat at many restaurants and don't mind paying a bit more for good food but when the bill came, and it was over ¬£53, I thought the quality of food was poor and not worth that at all.

This was my first time and I'd heard great things so was excited to visit.On arrival the restaurant we were asked to wait at the bar for drinks for 15 mins so a table could be prepared. We waited for 10 mins before any acknowledgement for drinks and a further 5 after that, but alas no drinks before we were seated.A waitress took our drinks order and delivered 2 bottles of water, but no glasses. We requested glasses and after 5-10 mins for waiting for these we went to the bar and got some ourselves from the waiter behind the bar. We could also see our drinks order sitting at the bar undelivered for a good 5 mins. We ordered food and it came, looking good. Unfortunately we had no cutlery, we had to ask for some and waited some minutes for it (pretty sure the customer should not have to ask for cutlery..). We also had to query if we'd been given enough vegetables for 4 (we received 1 tray with the same amount as a table for 2). With a puzzled look, the waitress delivered us some more/the correct amount. One of the party had ordered the nut roast and realised that instead, without being informed, was given 2 unappealing vegetable burgers. On querying this, the waitress found out they'd run out and hadn't thought to ask or inform us.2 different waitresses then asked us if we wanted dessert menus and whilst waiting for desserts, one had to ask if we'd had them yet or not. We hadn't.So in short, the service was absolute calamatous. The staff were lovely but shouldn't need to apologise everytime they came to the table!

I have never before taken time out to write a review or complaint about an establishment but me and my partner‚Äôs experience definitely warrants one. We pre booked our table over the phone for 7:30pm on Saturday 2nd March 2019, being our anniversary.We arrived on time but were asked to wait at the bar whilst our table was being prepared.After 30 minutes we were seated with no apology. Once seated it seemed to take forever and a day for somebody to tend to us. When somebody finally came we order a bottle of Rioja. Unfortunately, the waiter who took the order must have fell of the face of the earth as this order did not arrive.Only after a further 30 minutes when my partner went to the bar in search for our drinks order, was a different waiter sent over to be reminded of what it was we ordered. Still, with no urgency from the staff we finally got our bottle only to be served along side 2 gin glasses to drink it from. We were told they had ran out of wine glasses only for the table directly next to us to be served a bottle of white wine, with wine glasses less than 5 minutes later. After one hour since arrival we were more than ready to order our food. We ordered mussels to share as a starter, I ordered a fillet medallion with dauphinois, mixed greens and a side of peppercorn sauce for my main.My partner ordered the vegetarian mushroom wellington with dauphinois and mixed greens also, for her main.We waited a further HOUR for our starter to arrive after asking staff multiple times when it might arrive. When it did arrive it was lovely. By this time I decided to time how long it would take for our mains to appear, we waited a further 90 minutes for this to happen. When they finally started to arrive my partners well done and over cooked mushroom wellington came out 5 minutes before my own main, which came with a side of chips rather than dauphinois and without peppercorn sauce. After sending it back to be corrected I finally got what I ordered, along side barely warm peppercorn sauce. All in this time my partner had almost finished her plate due to being so hungry. We ate our mains separately and with water as our wine had by this time long gone and didn‚Äôt want the hassle of ordering anything else! By the time we had finished our mains the kitchen had turned all lights off and the chef had left the building on his phone. We were near enough the last party in the restaurant. Once we had finished our plates very clearly unhappy, a waiter approached us with a half hearted apology and explained how they were in the middle of changing their team, which of course had nothing to do with us. All of this time the staff had no urgency toward us and seemed all over the place. It was almost offensive that on our anniversary night we were experiencing such a nightmare whilst staff were leaning against the bar chatting, we even saw 2 members of staff massaging each other‚Äôs shoulders and at one point a waitress twerked whilst waiting for food to deliver to her table. We had booked our table for the specific time of 7:30pm so as we could enjoy our night beyond our meal and go to a few bars. We left the restaurant at 11:30pm with our night completely ruined and in no mood to continue our night resulting in a taxi straight home. With our career‚Äôs and my partner being from Leeds and myself being from Leicester, we consider our time together very sacred. So to have such a disastrous night on our anniversary was very unsettling and upsetting.Overall, a total of 4 hours spent here that night, a catalog of errors and a disaster from start to finish!

It still does as a matter of fact but my last couple of experiences here have been tainted by the poor customer service and the wait for the meal. Already twice, and both times when sitting upstairs, I have had to wait substantially for my meal (more thank 35 minutes, which is a lot for a burger place). In both circumstances I had almost finished my drink by the time the food arrived (and let me add that when ordering tea, twice I received the wrong tea bag, had to wait for a new one and in the meantime the warm water became even milder). To add to the frustration was the fact that other tables received their food before I did although they had ordered later. There was one couple who ordered just before we did who waited almost 50 minutes for their food and then had to remind the staff that they had not yet received the sides to their meal. Having said that, these times I experienced delays have been when the restaurant was particularly busy; however, the rudeness of the staff did not help bear with the frustration: the table next to mine experienced a confrontation with the waitress; I had received no apologies for the wait, and to add to it all, when asked at the till if I had a good meal, I explained my frustrations and received as an answer ""oh it is normal when it is busy"" rather than an apology.

We ordered my 2 year old haddock goujons from little eaters menu. Half way through my daughters meal I noticed she wasnt breathing, her eyes where getting wider and wider and watering and she was getting very red in the face. Once she didnt answer me when asking if she was ok I knew straight away she was choking. My husband then had to stand her up on the chair and frantically hit her back to try and get what ever it was she was choking on out. After a minute or so of my daughter struggling to catch breath she eventually asked for her juice and knew something was in her throat as she was trying to cough it out herself. My husband then took my daughter to the toilet and stick his fingers down her throat which eventually cleared it. My daughter from that point refused all food. I then decided to break some of the Haddock up to feed my 10month old to find 2 fish bones in the fish. When finding these bones i knew this was what my daughter swallowed which got lodged in her throat. I am horrified that bones are being served in the fish which was ordered off the kids menu. Thorough checks should have been in place to make sure this doesn't happen to any child ordering off this menu. If I hadn't have gone to feed my 10month old we would never have found the bones and been able to warn others. This left my daughter upset and it took her untill today to stop talking about it. Also everyone in the restaurant knew my 2 year old was choking and we needed help. However 2 members of staff walked past as if nothing was happening. As soon as I alerted the manager of what just happened all I got was an apology. I then spoke to the manager again to let him know we was leaving as I was so angry with the whole situation and experience from the staff and manager when informing him about the bone. It wasnt untill I was leaving and he asked for the bones to show the chef I then expressed I am keeping a bone for a picture he then decided to take my details for a lady called Emily to be calling me back which I still havnt received this call.

For some context and better understanding, the restaurant is located in Place Jourdan best known in Brussels for Maison Antoine located the middle of the square which is one of the 2 oldest friteries priding with the best you can eat Belgian fries. There is an unwritten rule that you can serve the fries on all the terraces while ordering beer or something from the restaurants. This being said, we were 2 persons, I went to buy the fries (there are very long waiting ques usually) and my companion took a seat on the terrace of Ellis to order burgers and some drinks - important to mention that we talk about the terrace located in the middle of the square, across the road and not the terrace located on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant. Upon my return, drinks were already served and in less than 5 minutes a server brings the burgers. Seeing that we had the fries from Maison Antoine, he kindly informs us of the policy of Ellis that they don't allow their customers to buy and consume fries from somewhere else but as the burgers are served he is kind enough to make a joke and agrees to make an exception this time. Less than 5 minutes and the manager arrives informing us she is in charge and despite having the approval of her colleague waiter, we have to pack our fries in order to continue eating. Needless to say we were both enjoying the burgers up to that moment which lasted for another 5 minutes of intense debate during which we acknowledged the strict policy of the restaurant but as we were not informed before ordering, we asked to be left to finish our dinner in peace. Finally after several times asking, the lady visibly irritated by the fact that we did not agree to leave or pack our fries stormed out saying we'll pay a supplement. Of course our appetite was dead and asked for the check immediately. Having to pay inside by the counter (rule of the restaurant) I had to deal with the manager again as she tried to force me pay an extra amount of 3 Euros because not ordering fries from them with the threat that she will call the police if I don't agree.

Ordered some form of croquettes, tuna ceviche and octopus salad and garlic prawns. Garlic prawns never came. First three items painfully average - tuna soggy in the way that frozen and thawed fish is - not what I‚Äôd consider appropriate for ceviche. Octopus salty and devoid of flavour (apart from salty.) All in all food that is definitely not worth a 90 minute wait. There are tonnes of better places to eat in Lisbon. The people queuing outside the restaurant are kept there for a reason.

My main was ‚Äústicky bbq ribs‚Äù what I received was dry, unflavoured ribs with a small patch of bbq sauce that tasted horrible, the chips also had a nasty taste, my fianc√© had a 10oz sirloin that was so chewy he couldn‚Äôt eat it (he has never not finished a steak!!!) they replaced my daughters fish with the chicken wrap option which I returned before she even started it as the ‚Äúsalad‚Äù was sloppy and had clearly been sat under a hot lamp for far to long, even though we had only just ordered it!! After complaining the waitress explained that there was an offer that ‚Äúkids eat free‚Äù so she didn‚Äôt need to take them off of the bill, we paid full price for our meal and received no apology or offer of any sort of refund!!

It was the same story when we visited again though on a Monday evening. The service was slow though there was only one waitress and a manager on the floor as they had been hit by a lot of tables at the same time. This would have been ok but the first load of chips that we got came out looking and tasting like they had been refried and the blue cheese sauce had split. They were immediately replaced which was appreciated and the steak was well cooked if a bit charcoaly for my boyfriend's taste. As a good gesture they comped one of my drinks. The servers themselves were lovely just a shame about the wait and then the mistakes made with our food.,-1

The waiting staff and manager were great (although service was a bit slow, they were short staffed so I'll let them off) and the cocktails were delicious. We ordered the ham and leak croquettes to start which were also a delight. Unfortunately we did have a few issues with our mains. The steak was perfectly cooked to my preference (rare) however the chips for both mine and my partner's meal seemed as if they had been recooked and the sauce for my steak (blue cheese sauce) had split. The manager kindly fixed this, getting us fresh chips and a new sauce, which is why I've given it three stars rather than less. He was also kind enough to knock a little off the bill for the inconvenience, which was appreciated. I'm hoping today was just an off day for them as the staff seemed pleasant, however this experience wasn't the best, but by far it definitely wasn't the worst.",-1

While living in the Netherlands I had my first date with my bf there and since then it became our tradition to go back every special time. Now, living in Gent, the idea was keeping that alive, but things have gone sour. First of all, something that its quite sad, the fries, at least somewhere at the end of 2015 beginning of 2016 (while still in the NL) fries were proper potato wedges which later became the frozen normal fries you get in the frituur place... I know you still have the sweet potato wedges but apparently getting decent salty ones is no longer an option. It really gave you edge against other peasant places with the common fries. Secondly, why on earth did you remove your strawberry lemonade from the menu, you were the only place where I could find a decent lemonade that was not the disgusting syrope+water drink that you normally get on the kids' menu. I have tried the new hibiscus and other infusions but they are not comparable to the deceased strawberry lemonade. Thirdly, I have ordered at least 10 times on uber eats putting extra comments on adding an extra Ellis sauce which is worth of all my respects since I believe it is great (I LOVE THAT SAUCE) and adds a lot of value to either the burger or the already sad fries... but no... I cannot get the sauce in my order. Apparently, it is impossible for either the uber eats guy or the place to put it inside my bag. Does it have an extra cost?? let me know and I gladly pay it, however, when being in the establishment I have ordered extra sauce several times with no problem nor extra charge... so, what's up there? I just came back from one-month surgery recovery, and I ordered my usual, guess what, no sauce...If there was one thing I could have rescued from the new era would be the cheesecake with the bits of raspberry and chocolate, but guess what, last time I ordered it wasn't on my bag...Why guys!!! Please bring Ellis back to its shiny days... Sincerelya soon former fan of Ellis burger",-1

When the food did came, the starter was very obviously microwaved (the plate was hotter than the food itself) and the main course (Crispy fried chicken burger) was not very well salted and not at all crispy. My dad used to take me to fridays in Greece when I was a teenager, and I have to say the quality of the food in Utrecht was much lower than what I had gotten used to.

The person had no knowledge of the type/cut of steaks available - only the breeds Angus or Holstein. Only 1 of the 3 steaks on your menu had the cut, the Tomahawk. That is not helpful in understanding the amount of fat, marbling, etc to share a huge steak for a table. Second, the steak took 2.5 hours to come out and arrived 1.5 hours after we finished our appetizers. I asked several times and the waiter said it's coming any minute. He never tried to help or seemed concerned with how dissatisfied we were. Not a good experience to wait that long for your mains to arrive with no food on the table. Third, I emailed about getting a dessert with sparklers/fireworks for the table for my wife's birthday. Your team emailed me that this would happen. The waiter forgot.
